==Particle in a Box==
===Description===
A particle in an infinite square well (also called a particle in a box), where the well is between x=0 and x=L, experiences infinite potential everywhere outside the box and 0 potential everywhere inside the box (between 0 < x < L), so the particle cannot escape the bounds {0,L}. The kets, in wavefunction notation, are given by

The values for energy are given by

It is impossible to determine the probability of finding the particle at a particular point in the well, but the probability of finding the particle within a region {a,b} is given by

Since the particle must be somewhere within the well:

In other words, the total probability of finding the particle anywhere in the well is 1.
