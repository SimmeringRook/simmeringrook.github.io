'''Definition''':
The [[Simple_Harmonic_Motion#Frequency_and_Period|frequency]] at which a system would [[Oscillations|oscillate]] at if disturbed and then allowed to oscillate freely.
The symbol typically used to denote this is '''ω''', or when in an equation with more than one angular frequencies, will be referred to as '''ω_0'''.

This natural frequency is a result of properties of the system.
For an [[LC Circuit|LC circuit]], ''ω'' is defined by (L*C)^-1; where ''L'' is the inductance of the [[Inductor|inductor]] and ''C'' is the capacitance of the [[Capacitor|capacitor]].
For a mass on a spring, ''ω'' is defined by the ratio of the square root of ''k'' ([[Hooke's Law]]) to the mass, ''m''.
