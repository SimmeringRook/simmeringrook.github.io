Molecular Orbitals of 1_D Solid:

Approximations:
1) LCAO

2) no-overlapping

3) nearest neighbor interactions
  ~H ~C = E ~C
      ~H is = hI + s(S^up + S^down)
      ~C => |psi> = Sum of j=0 to N ( C_j |j> )

qa = 2pil/N; q= 2pi/(N a)

For N -> infty
q becomes continous

|Psi_q> = Sum of (j = 0) to infty {C_j |j>}
  = Sum of (j = 0) to infty {exp(iqja)· Psi_atom (x-ja)}

~H ~C_q = E_q ~C_q

  ~H·~C_q = h(~C_q)+s(exp(iqa)+exp(-iqa))(~C_q)

      =[h+2·s·cos(qa)](~C_q)

E_q = h+2·s·cos(qa)

h, s are negative

Minimum energy is when qa=0
Maximum energy is when qa=pi

Properties of Molecular Orbitals

Psi_q (x) = Sum of (j=0)U(infty) { exp(iqaj)·psi_atom(x-ja) }
-> Discretized fourier series/transformation
