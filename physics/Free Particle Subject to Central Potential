Particle in 3 Space in the Presence of a Central potential

This is an approximation of a Hydrogen atom (All ions that have one electron orbiting around a nucleus: He^+ and Li^++).

==Central Potential==
For this system, the potential is given by a spherically symmetric central potential:

V(r)= - (Ze^2)/(4*pi*epsilon_0*r)


==Derivation==

The energy eigenvalue equation for a particle of mass mu subject to an arbitrary central potential V(r) is:

We can use our solution for the spherical harmonics, Y(\theta, \phi), in forming our ansatz
for a \psi(r,\theta,\phi). Through separation of variables, our ansatz becomes:

\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r)Y(\theta,\phi) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi)

separates into two equations:

'''TODO''' Radial Equation
'''TODO''' Angular Equation

==Energy Eigenvalue Equation==

H·|n,l,m> = E_n |n,l,m>

where: |n,l,m> = R_n,l(r)Y_l,m(\theta,\phi)

E_n= -1/n^2 [(mu Z^2 /(2 \hbar^2))· (e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0))^2 ]

We want energy to be negative, because we're only concerned with bound state electrons at this point.

==Principle Quantnum Number==
