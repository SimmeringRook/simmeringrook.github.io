'''Definition''':
Resonance is when the velocity amplitude of an oscillating system reaches its global maximum.
This effect becomes noticeable as the [[Forced Oscillations|driving frequency]], ''ω_d'', approaches the resonance frequency, ''ω_f''.

The value of ''ω_f'' is dependent on the amount of [[Damping|damping]] present in the system, as well as the system's [[Characteristic Angular Frequency|natural frequency]].
For systems with no dampening:

ω_f = ω_0

With dampening:

ω_f = ω_1

==Q Factor==
Also known as '''quality factor''', this is describes the ratio between the [[Characteristic Angular Frequency|natural frequency]]
 and the [[Damping|damping]] present in the system. This dimensionless value directly and quantitatively describes how underdamped an [[Oscillations|oscillator]] is.
The following are the formulas for calculating the Q factor for:
*A Generalized Oscillator:
