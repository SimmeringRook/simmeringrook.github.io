The [[Spacetime Interval]] in flat space instructs us to use Hyperbola geometry to describe spacetime, not Euclidean. From this, we can derive the metric that will give us the distance between two events:
*; Spacelike
*:# œÉ^2 = s^2 - t^2
*:# œÅ^2 = x^2 - (ct)^2

*; Timelike
*:# ùúè^2 = t^2 - s^2
*:# -œÅ^2 = x^2 - (ct)^2
<br />

==Timelike==
''Also the '''metric'''?''
Also referred to as '''proper time''' or '''wristwatch time'''. This is time measured
according to the object in the [[Inertial Reference Frame|inertial reference frame]].
All observers agree on this measured time by using the following formula:

'''Replace with picture:'''

tau^2 = t^2 - s^2

where t is the frame time and s is the frame distance between two pair of events.

==Spacelike==
Also referred to as '''proper distance'''. This is the spatial measurement that
all observers will agree on. It too requires the object and observers to be in
[[Inertial Reference Frame|inertial reference frames]].

'''Replace with picture:'''

sigma^2 = s^2 - t^2

[[File:Spacelike_Spacetime_Interval.png]]

where t is the frame time and s is the frame distance between two pair of events.
