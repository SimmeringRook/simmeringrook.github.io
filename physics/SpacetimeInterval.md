# Spacetime Interval

?> The Spacetime Interval (in flat space) instructs us on how to use Hyperbolic geometry to describe the separation between events in spacetime. More generally, this is referred to as the **Metric**.

## Spacelike

There are two classifications for the types of separations possible between events. When the separation between them is greater spatially than temporally, we use the **Spacelike** version of the metric.

#### Exploring Black Holes

$$\sigma^2 = s^2 - t^2$$

Non-invariant variables:
>- $s$ denotes the spatial separation (as measured from an inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$
>- $t$ denotes the time separation (as measured by the same inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$

Invariant variables:
>- $\sigma$ denotes the [Proper Distance] between events
>   - dimensions of $length$


#### Geometry of Special Relativity

$$\rho^2 = x^2 - (ct)^2$$

Non-invariant variables:
>- $x$ denotes the spatial separation (as measured from an inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$
>- $t$ denotes the time separation (as measured by the same inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $time$

Invariant variables:
>- $c$ denotes the [Speed of Light]
>   - units of $\frac{cm}{s}$
>   - dimensions of $\frac{length}{time}$
>   - typically has value set to $1$ ([natural units](/physics/NaturalUnits.md))
>- $\rho$ denotes the [Proper Distance] between events
>   - dimensions of $length$

## Timelike

Similarly, we describe the separation between events that are greater in time than space as **Timelike**:

#### Exploring Black Holes

$$\tau^2 = t^2 - s^2$$

Non-invariant variables:
>- $t$ denotes the time separation (as measured by the same inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$
>- $s$ denotes the spatial separation (as measured from an inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$

Invariant variables:
>- $\tau$ denotes the [Proper Time] between events
>   - dimensions of $length$

#### Geometry of Special Relativity

$$-(\rho^2) = (ct)^2 - x^2$$

Non-invariant variables:
>- $x$ denotes the spatial separation (as measured from an inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $length$
>- $t$ denotes the time separation (as measured by the same inertial reference frame)
>   - dimensions of $time$

Invariant variables:
>- $c$ denotes the [Speed of Light]
>   - units of $\frac{cm}{s}$
>   - dimensions of $\frac{length}{time}$
>   - typically has value set to $1$ ([natural units](/physics/NaturalUnits.md))
>- $\rho$ denotes the [Proper Time] between events
>   - dimensions of $length$
