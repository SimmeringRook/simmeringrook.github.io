===Derivation===
This derivation will be analogous to that performed for a mechanical system in the [[Simple_Harmonic_Motion#Differential_Equation| Simple Harmonic Motion]]
page.

We begin by analyzing the circuit using [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]], which states that:

Replacing the voltage terms with their definitions in terms of charge, we arrive at the following differential equation:

Note that, in this case, we define Ï‰_0 as the inverse of the capacitor multiplied by the inductor:

===General Solutions===
Given that the differential equation has the same form as that derived for a mechanical harmonic oscillator, the same solutions are valid for this equation.
