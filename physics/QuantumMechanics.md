## Quantum Postulates
### Postulate 1
>The [[Quantum State|state]] of a [[Quantum Mechanical System|quantum mechanical system]], including all the information you can know about it, is represented mathematically by a [[Normalization|normalized]] [[Ket|ket]].

Uses:

We use Postulate 1 to form the definition of each [[Quantum State|quantum state vector]], imposing that each
state must be normalized. The other powerful side to employing this postulate, is that we know the probabilities for every
possible measurement that can be obtained from this state. For [[Spin#Spin_1.2F2|Spin 1/2]] systems, this power can be used to find unknown
probabilities. For systems have have an infinite number of measurements, such as the energy states for [[Quantum_Mechanical_System#Particle_in_a_Box|Particle in a Box]] or [[Quantum_Mechanical_System#Particle_on_a_Ring|Particle on a Ring]],
the power of the first postulate lets us easily determine which of the infinite possible measurements have a nonzero probability.

### Postulate 2
> A physical [[Observable|observable]] is represented mathematically by an [[Operator|operator]] A that acts on [[Ket|ket]]s.

Uses:


### Postulate 3
> The only possible result of a measurement of an [[Observable|observable]] is one of the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalues]], a_n, of the corresponding [[Operator|operator]] A.

Uses:

### Postulate 4
> The probability of obtaining the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] an in a measurement of the [[Observable|observable]] A on the system in a state is given by: $P=\abs{\bra{a_n}\ket{\psi}}^2$, where $\ket{a_n}$ is the normalized [[Eigenvector|eigenvector]] of $\hat{A}$ corresponding to the [[Eigenvalue|eigenvalue]] $a_n$.

Uses:

### Postulate 5
> After a measurement of A that yields the result a_n, the quantum system is in a new state that is the [[Normalization|normalized]] [[Projection|projection]] of the original system [[Ket|ket]] onto the [[Ket|ket(s)]] corresponding to the result of the measurement:

Uses:

> The time evolution of a quantum system is determined by the Hamiltonian or total energy operator H(t) through the [[Schr√∂dinger Equation]].
