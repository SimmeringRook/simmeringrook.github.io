?>**Definition**:
The charge model let's us simplify electrostatic problems by only requiring
adherence to the following postulates.

## Postulate 1
There are only two kinds of charge, '''positive''' and '''negative'''.

Benjamin Franklin discovered these two charges from rubbing plastic and glass
with different types of cloth and observing attractive and repulsive behaviour.
A glass rod charged by a silk cloth is considered to be positively charged;
 whereas a Plastic rod charged by a wool cloth is considered negatively charged.

### Postulate 1.1
Objects are charged by adding or removing electrons.

### Postulate 1.2
The magnitude of the elementary charge is measured empirically as:

  1.60 x 10^-19 C

Both protons and electrons have the same magnitude of charge. In fact, we can
calculate the charge of an object by the following formula:

  q = (N_p - N_e)Â·e

  where:
    q   is the charge
    N_p is the number of protons
    N_e is the number of electrons
    e   is the elementary charge

An object with an equal number of protons and electrons (q = 0) is said to be
'''neutral'''.

## Postulate 2
There are two categories for materials when dealing with charge: '''insulators'''
and '''conductors'''.

===[[Insulators]]===
Charge remains fixed inside or on the outside of an material.

===[[Conductors]]===
Charge is able to easily (and quickly) move and shift on or throughout the material.

## Postulate 3
Charged objects exert a force on each other.

### Postulate 3.1
If the objects are of the same charge, the force exerted will repel the objects
from each other. If the objects are of opposite charges, the force will attract
each other. This force is called the [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb Force]] or Electrostatic
force.

### Postulate 3.2
Charged objects can attract neutral objects through '''polarization'''.

Polarization results in shifting the electron sea or creating [[Electric Dipole|electric dipoles]]
in the atoms of the neutral object. As such, this polarization force is always
attractive (see Postulate 3.1).
