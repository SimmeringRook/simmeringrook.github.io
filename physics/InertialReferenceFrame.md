'''Definition''': A reference frame in which [[Newton's First Law]] is obeyed. Another way to consider this is that there is a net force of 0 acting on the body in the frame. The size of a frame can be arbitrarily sized as long as the initial criteria is maintained. We can then say that objects traveling in these frames are said to have natural motion.
<br /><br />

==Usage==
A reference frame is a method of recording the space and time at which an event occurs.

==Examples==
===Ex 1===
You toss a pen into the air. You, as the [[Observer|observer]], could [[Phiscal Models#Kinematics|model]] the vertical motion of the pen with a [[Parabola|parabola]], approximated using [[Newton's Second Law]]. We would note that the only non-negligible [[Force|force]] acting on the pen is [[Gravity|gravity]] from the [[Earth]].
<br />
Note that from your point of view, the (zoomed in) Observer on Earth, the pen as described in your frame of reference is not an inertial reference frame. Zooming out and considering more of Earth does not help this situation either; as we begin to consider more of the Earth, we then have to start considering the rotation of the Earth. Any reference frame on the surface of the Earth that accounts for the rotation of the Earth about its axis is strictly <strong>not</strong> an inertial reference frame. See the presence of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference#Separating_non-inertial_from_inertial_reference_frames fictious forces (Wikipedia)].
<br />
However, as a counter point, we can note that there does exist a local inertial reference frame for the pen. Consider the observer in the same reference frame as the pen. We can still apply the laws of Physics universally, but just consider the pen (and local observer) as stationary or with constant velocity - adhering to Newton's First Law. Then, we as the local observer see the Earth accelerate away from the pen initially, before accelerating back towards the pen until their inevitable collision.
<br />
This reference frame is inertial from the moment the thrower ceases contact with the pen and until the Earth makes contact with the pen again. We must exercise caution, however, because this frame is only inertial during that small interval.
