# Forced Oscillations

?>**Definition**: External driving frequency, either referred to as $\omega$ (with no subscript) or $\omega_{d}$ (as in $\omega_{\text{driving}}$).

## Implications
A [simple harmonic oscillator](/physics/Oscillations.md) system experiences an external force that causes it to oscillate at the  frequency from this *"driving"* force. The addition of this force changes the differential equations for mechanical and electrical systems from second order [homogeneous] ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients into second
order [inhomogeneous] ODEs.

The changes to the general solutions and their forms are as follows:

### Mechanical

### Electrical

## Phase Offsets
