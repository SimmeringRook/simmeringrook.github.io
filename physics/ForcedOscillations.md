?>**Definition**: External driving frequency, either referred to as $\omega$ (with no subscript) or $\omega_{d}$ (as in $\omega_{\text{driving}}$).

==Implications==
An [[Oscillations|oscillator]] must oscillate at the driving frequency.
The addition of this force changes the differential equations for mechanical and electrical systems
from second order [[Homogeneous|homogeneous]] ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients into second
order [[Homogeneous#Inhomogeneous|inhomogeneous]] ODEs.

The changes to the general solutions and their forms are as follows:

===Mechanical===

===Electrical===
