?>**Definition**: A ket is the representation of a [Vector](/maths/Vector.md) in Dirac notation.

## Forms
### Dirac
In Dirac notation, kets are represented as:

$$\vert\psi\rang$$

### Matrix
In Matrix notation, kets are represented as column matrices:

$$\vert\psi\rang \doteq\begin{pmatrix}
\lang a_1\vert\psi\rang \\
\vdots
\\ \lang a_n \vert\psi\rang
\end{pmatrix}$$
