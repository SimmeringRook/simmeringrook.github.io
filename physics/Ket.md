?>**Definition**: A ket is the representation of a [Vector](/maths/Vector.md) in Dirac notation.

## Forms
### Dirac
In Dirac notation, kets are represented as:

$$\ket{\psi}$$

### Matrix
In Matrix notation, kets are represented as column matrices:

$$\vert\psi\rang \doteq\begin{array}{c}
\lang a_1\vert\psi\rang \\
\vdots
\\ \braket{a_n \vert\psi}\end{array}$$
