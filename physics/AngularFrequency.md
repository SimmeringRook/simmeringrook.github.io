# Angular Frequency

?>**Definition:** The frequency at which an object rotates.

## Characteristic Angular Frequency

?>**Definition**: The [frequency](/physics/SimpleHarmonicMotion#Frequency-and-Period.md) at which a system would [[Oscillations|oscillate]] at if disturbed and then allowed to oscillate freely. The symbol typically used to denote this is $\omega$, or when in an equation with more than one angular frequencies, will be referred to as $\omega_0$.

This natural frequency is a result of properties of the system.
For an [[LC Circuit|LC circuit]], ''ω'' is defined by (L*C)^-1; where ''L'' is the inductance of the [[Inductor|inductor]] and ''C'' is the capacitance of the [[Capacitor|capacitor]].
For a mass on a spring, ''ω'' is defined by the ratio of the square root of ''k'' ([[Hooke's Law]]) to the mass, ''m''.
