# Angular Frequency

?>**Definition:** The frequency at which an object rotates.

## Characteristic Angular Frequency

?>**Definition**: The [frequency](/physics/SimpleHarmonicMotion#Frequency-and-Period.md) at which a system would [[Oscillations|oscillate]] at if disturbed and then allowed to oscillate freely. The symbol typically used to denote this is $\omega$, or when in an equation with more than one angular frequencies, will be referred to as $\omega_0$.

This natural frequency is a result of properties of the system.
- For an [LC Circuit](/physics/LCCircuit.md), $\omega$ is defined by the inverse of the product between $L$ and $C$; where $L$ is the inductance of the [inductor] and $C$ is the capacitance of the [capacitor].

$$\omega_0 \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

- For a mass on a spring, $\omega$ is defined by the ratio of the square root of $k$ ([Hooke's Law](/physics/HookesLaw.md)) to the mass, $m$.

$$\omega_0\equiv \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
