LCAO Approximation of Simple Model

Hamiltonian of 2 atoms

H= p^2 /2m + (-gamma)delta(x-a) + (-gamma)delta(x+a)

Energy of bound state must be less than 0, so the particle doesn't escape to infinity

LCAO = Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals

Assumptions:
->The atomic orbital Psi is a superposition of both atomic Orbitals
->Simplify Hamiltonian Eigenvalue Equation
    Reduce to:

    <1|H|Psi> = E <1|Psi>
    <2|H|Psi> = E <2|Psi>

    Which we can rewrite as a matrix equation

      ~H (c1, c2)^T = E (c1, c2)^T

      where ~H is ((h, s), (s, h)) check mini-lecture from 27 May for values of
      h and s

Essential Steps to general to more atoms:

  1. Starting point is the equation:

    ~H ~C = E ~C;
      ~H is ((h, s), (s, h)), ~C = (c1, c2)^T

      Find the Eigenvectors
      Normalize the eigenvectors

  2. ~C_even = 1/sqrt(2) (1,1)^T; ~C_odd = 1/sqrt(2) (1, -1)^T

    E_even = h+s;   E_odd = h-s

    a is the radius of the molecule

    Which energy level holds the two atoms? Which energy level pushes the two appart?

    Consider the plots where all constants other than a are set to 1.
    Plotting this, we see that E_even starts below the a-axis and asymptotically approaches -1.
    We then see that E_odd starts above the a-axis and asymptotically approaches +1.

    Therefore E_even wants to pull the atoms together and E_odd wants to push away.

    LCAO approximation works best when the separation between the atoms is large.

Benzine Example

  We have 6 atoms

  1. Start with the monster equations

    ~H ~C = E ~C

      We need to find ~H:

        Assume that the molecular orbital is a superposition of the atom Orbitals

        Psi = c_1 |1> + c_2 |2> + c_3 |3> + c_4 |4> + c_5 |5> +c_6 |6>

        Instead of solving H|psi>=E|psi>

          We do: <i|H|psi> = E<i|psi>, i = 1, ... , 6


        This lets us write ~H as:

            ((<1|H|1>, <1|H|2>, ..., <1|H|6>)
             (<2|H|1>, ..., <2|H|6>),
             ...
             (..., <6|H|6>))

        Nearest Neighbor Interactions:
          The matrix elements of ~H are only nonzero if the two atoms are next to each other.
          E.g. :

          ((h, s, 0, 0, 0, s)
           (s, h, s, 0, 0, 0)=,
           ...
           (s, 0, 0, 0, s, h))

           ~H = hI + s(S^up + S^down)

      2. Find eigenvector of ~H matrix

          ~C = (1, lambda, lambda^2, lambda^3, lambda^4, lambda^5, lambda^6)^T

          lambda = (1)^(1/6) = exp(i2piL/6); L = 0, ..., 5

          -> We have six eigenvectors: (Normalize them)

          C_1 = 1/sqrt(6) (1, exp(i2piL/6), exp(i2piL/6 · 2), ..., exp(i2piL/6 · 5))

          Find energies by plugging eigenvectors into Matrix equation:

            E_L =
