?>**Definition**: A bra is the [Hermitian Adjoint|Hermitian adjoint]] of a [Ket](/physics/Ket.md). The primary use of the bra representation is for taking the [Inner Product|inner product]] of a systemâ€™s [Eigenvector]($1) with a quantum state to find the probability that the corresponding [Eigenvalue](\$\1) will be measured.

## Forms
### Dirac
In Dirac notation, bras are represented as:

$$\lang\psi\vert$$

### Matrix
In Matrix notation, bras are represented as row matrices:

$$\lang\psi\vert\doteq\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\lang a_1\vert\psi\rang , & \dots , & \lang a_n \vert\psi\rang \end{array}\right)$$
