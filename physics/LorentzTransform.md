## Uses
This transformation is typically only used when applying Special Relativity. It can be used with Classical Mechanics without issue, but tends to add complexity to otherwise simple problems. This transformation corrects the error of adding velocities with the [[Galilean Transform|Galilean Transformation]] which would state that an object could travel faster than light.

This transformation is derived from Hyperbola Geometry.

## Method
The Lorentz Transformation is a [[Linear Map|linear transformation]] and corresponds to a rotation, translation, or both, in spacetime.

<strong>TODO:: Add the method here</strong>

### Distance
Note that the distance between two events as measured with Galilean geometry uses the hyperbolic form of the Pythagorean Theorem:
  d^2 = x^2 - y^2
