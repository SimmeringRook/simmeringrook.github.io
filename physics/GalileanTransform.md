==Uses==
This transformation is used in the framework of Classical Mechanics. It is taught as the default transformation when taking introductory Physics courses without being explicitly named. This transformation operates intuitively with how we see interactions in the world around us.

==Method==
The Galilean Transformation is a [[Linear Map|linear transformation]] and corresponds to a rotation, translation, or both, in spacetime.

<strong>TODO:: Add the method here</strong>

===Distance===
Note that the distance between two events as measured with Galilean geometry uses the triangular form of the Pythagorean Theorem:
  d^2 = x^2 + y^2

==Invariance==
<strong>TODO:: Elaborate</strong>
