?>**Definition**: A simple circuit that contains a [[Inductor]], [[Capacitor]], and [[Resistor]].

[[File:LCR_Circuit_Schematic.png]]

This circuit is an example of extending the model [[Simple_Harmonic_Motion|simple harmonic motion]] for an [[LC Circuit]] by the
addition of [[Damping|Damping]].

## Properties
### Driving Voltage Behavior
*ω_d << ω_1 -> the circuit behaves like capacitor
*ω_d ≈ ω_1 -> the circuit behaves like resistor
*ω_d >> ω_1 -> the circuit behaves like inductor
