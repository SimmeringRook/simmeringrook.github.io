## GPA

As you will notice when looking at my GPA and my transcripts, I was not ready to move onto a college education in 2009. I had been able to demonstrate my knowledge through tests, but this success masked my undiagnosed ADHD to myself and those around me. My previous methods of progressing through courses did not mesh with the additional freedom offered in college education. After attempting two semesters at UNLV, I resolved to enlist in the US Army to train me in discipline and provide income to be able to pay my incurred student loan debt while figuring out what my future would look like.

The time in the Army forced me to develop a system of coping mechanisms that allowed me to return to a pursuit of education in 2014 and were sufficient to allow me to demonstrate the extent of my knowledge and ability to solve problems with the completion of my Associates in Computer Programming from FTCC. I then tried to continue my education by pursuing a BSc in Computer Science through Oregon State University, but I ran into wall where my coping could not allow further progress.

Leveraging my passion for problem solving, I resolved to pursue a different major, Physics, and return to Computer Science later in the future. To my benefit, the intriguing content and difficult problems meshed very well with the hyper-focusing aspect of ADHD and provided me with a long enough lifeline to increase my GPA while beginning to pursue answers about differences in experiences.

## Communication into Teaching

Ultimately, the diagnosis and subsequent medication has improved my ability to live my life and succeed academically. While not unique, this entire experience has increased my awareness in the faults of communication between students and teacher. Working as a Learning Assistant with excellent PER mentors, I have been able to realize another passion of mine: I find teaching and guiding others to solve a problem equally rewarding to solving the problem myself.

During the previous two years, I have really enjoyed helping students and professors connect. I am eager to continue to learn about how to effectively share knowledge with more junior students and bridge the gaps in misunderstanding.

# Discord

## Before COVID

It started because the way students were collaborating outside of class for PH 455 was through SnapChat. SnapChat is great for social things, not sharing or discussing work (images/text auto delete upon viewing by default). Discord was free and had minimal steps for sign up at the time, and creating your own server didn't require extra stuff like self-hosting (a la simmeringrook wiki).

The goal was to allow easier collaboration regarding the homework for that class: people could take pictures of their work (paper, whiteboard, blackboard) and share it with the group with minimal effort and then everyone could easily monitor and participate in the discussion.

## What changed when the Fire COVID attacked?

At its heart, the goal was to facilitate collaboration between classmates. Once we started remote classes, I opted to make it open-invite instead of a closed study group. We had trouble figuring out how to capture the effect of working in 304F or the SPS club room in the virtual sense.

Early on, I had figured out how to enable co-host privileges on my personal student zoom room to give a place for members of my study group a place to work throughout the day/evening. There was essentially at least one person in there at all times, and it helped capture most of the in-person collaboration as we discussed approaches or debated possible solutions.

After noting that other classmates were having issues with the lack of 304F/SPS, I changed the discord to be suited for the classes and give a open forum for people to interact with each other synchronously (set up zoom meetings) or asynchronously (share images of work/messages).

Beyond just the school work, we also noted the lack of socializing, and begun siloing work/school conversations and off-topic channels to help everyone stay connected (#pet-pictures did wonders for moral).

## The continuation of the Pandemic

As we figured out that classes were going to continue to be remote for the foreseeable future, we took steps to provide structure for conversations, but also open up the avenues of communication beyond just a handful of courses.

For every non-physics course I attended, there was a channel created and the membership grew. After being hired as a Learning Assistant for the Paradigms, we noticed how useful this could be for outside of class interactions with the students. I asked the members of the server if they wanted it to be a student run/member community and they said yes. This seemed to provide the push for students to use the medium to communicate that never seemed to occur with the teaching team present in Slack channels.

This also gave another avenue for Learning Assistants to communicate with students by helping to guide the discussions and alleviate misunderstandings from lecture. Over time, the membership of the server increased from the graduating class to a big majority of the Physics major. We also started to gather a few sub communities of other STEM majors.

# Guiding Frozen Star

## Catalyst

It began on a warm summer's day in the humid south of North Carolina. While in my final semester of FTCC (in obtaining my Asc. in Computer Programming), I stumbled across a gif that showed the visualization of what it would look like for an observer to free fall into a Black Hole. This animation terrified me but planted a seed of curiosity.

Up until this point, my only knowledge of Black Holes had come from Science fiction movies and TV shows. As I read the comments from others on reddit, I saw a claim from one person that if the black hole were big enough, the tidal forces wouldn't cause fatal spaghettification. Eager to find out what the threshold mass for a non-lethal passing through the event horizon, I begun searching for answers online but to no avail.

Ultimately, I reasoned I could find the corresponding radial distance by looking for where the acceleration would be at least equivalent to Earth's surface gravity. My methodology in finding this distance was greatly hampered by very little knowledge of physics (the high school class was rudimentary and a decade ago) and mathematics (I had dealt with differential calculus, but lacked the maturity in solving problems beyond algebra and unaware of integrals and their power - let alone vectors).

As my skillset at the time revolved around computational functions and their solutions, I used that style of research to discover the inverse square law and the gravity obeyed it. Since I had no formal framing of the question, I couldn't use Newton's Second Law (unaware of its existence or the vector equation for gravity); however, I could obtain an algebraic expression and find the value of $r$ through a binary search.

## Time Evolution

Originally, I intended to obtain a Bsc. in Computer Science, but as I progressed forward, I ran into conflict with how the College of Engineering structured their gates. Noting that signs pointed dangerously to repeating UNLV (and without the knowledge of dealing with ADHD), I faced a decision between two alternate majors: Mathematics or Physics.

During my time at LBCC, I had amazing expreiences with both subjects: Shannon Herbert for Math and Greg Moulder in Physics. Both professors kindled the curiousity about their respective subjects and were very open to my eagerness to learn more than just the course material. I also revisited by black hole question periodically, refining the mathematical formulation or approach to a possible solution as new tools were introduced and mastered (e.g., anti-derivatives and the interplay of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and forces as parameterized vector equations).

Ultimately, I chose physics as it gave a practical context to the concepts being taught in the math courses. A direct benefit to resolving this question came through a junior level physics course called PH 315: Challenges in Contemporary Physics. I truly fell in love with Physics during this course as it worked directly to build a proper method to approaching problems and how to solve them. This course required a term project which allowed me the  chance to truly answer my question, or so I thought.

Having a gap in my spare time, I directed that energy and curiosity towards learning more about these tools and to push myself farther. In courses, this manifested by developing and improving my solutions to homework problems. In undergraduate research, this manifested by choosing an ambitious goal of working with General Relativity. In the degree, I started exhausting the available electives and then filling the void with graduate level courses.

## Independence

Following the completion of PH 455: Astrophysics, I knew I wanted to continue to learn more. It was my first upper division elective and opened my eyes into the vast depth that Physics as a subject had. At this time, I interviewed a few other professors as apart of the process to find a mentor for my undergraduate thesis. Dr. Kathryn Hadley and I instantly bonded over our curiosity about black holes.

Kathy does computational research into the formulation of proto-stellar systems and offered me the chance to co-study General Relativity with her. Concurrent to the Paradigms, we began working through Special Relativity and into dealing with Schwarzschild geometry. General Relativity, as a course, is only offered at OSU every other year and I resolved to complete the necessary mathematical perquisites in order to have an additional source of information to further my research.

Originally, my undergraduate thesis sought to resolve an unanswered question of Kathy's, but as we worked to formalize the question at the start of this academic year, we discovered the theoretical aspect had already been answered. Not wanting to waste all the time, effort, and knowledge gained, we managed to pivot to me spearheading the formulation of a computational relativistic framework that could be understood and used by future undergraduate students of hers and integrated into the proto-stellar computational models.
