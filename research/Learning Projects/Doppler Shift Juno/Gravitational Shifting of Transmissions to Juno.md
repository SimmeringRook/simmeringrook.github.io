Inspired as an extension of [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|Project A]] from [[Exploring Black Holes]]. This question seeks to estimate the effects of [[Gravitational Red Shifting]] and Blue shifting of a transmission from Earth to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft) Juno spacecraft (Wikipedia)].

## Problem Statement
Does the curvature of spacetime, due to the presence of Earth and Jupiter, effect how a transmission from Earth to the Juno spacecraft would be received? Is this effect significant enough that we design spacecraft to receive a wide band of frequencies or allow variable frequencies for contact?

*; Overview:
*: I originally sought to find the amount of gravitational shifting by using the Schwarzschild Metric similar to Queries 1-3 from [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|EBH's Project A]]. The core idea was to measure the ratio in clock tick intervals at Juno with respect to Earth and Jupiter separately, and then combine them for a measure of total clock tick displacement from flat space.
<br />
*; Outcome:
*: This approach dead ended as the combination of ratios does not make physical sense. A more rigorous mathematical background may be required before approaching this problem from this angle.

*; Overview:
*: The intent was to simplify the problem by focusing on the problem statement and sidestepping the issue of 'total' curvature. I compared the gravitational shifting of each body to flat space, and then each body to the [[Lagrange Point|L1 Lagrange Point]] between Earth and Jupiter.
<br />
*; Outcome:
*: This approach appears to give me a valid answer for the framework of my question. The result is not a startlingly discovery, which should be expected as it would be a notable case study of ''visible'' effects of GR (similar to the GPS system).

*; Overview:
*: Building off the framework of the second question, I will attempt to remove some simplifications and consider more contributions to the shifting of the transmission, most notably the [[Doppler Effect]] from orbital velocities of Earth and Jupiter about the Sun's location.
<br />
*; Outcome:
*: I need to attempt this. <strong>TODO:: Attempt this variation of the question.</strong>
