=== After the fact commentary ===

I originally sought to find the amount of red shifting as the transmission left Earth and the amount of blue shifting as the transmission approached Jupiter by using the concepts derived from [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|EBH's Project A]]. The idea was to measure the ratio in clock tick intervals at Juno with respect to the equator of Earth, and the ratio in clock tick intervals at Juno with respect to the equator of Jupiter.
<br /><br />

Drawing inspiration from how we would use [[Superposition]] of forces to describe the net gravitational force on Juno, my intent was to use a linear combination of the [[Schwarzschild Metric]] ratios to discuss the difference in clock tick intervals everywhere in spacetime (considering only a universe consisting of Earth, Jupiter, and Juno).
<br /><br />

This approach seemed promising and lead to questions about [[Curved Spacetime#Negative_Curvature|Negative Curvature of Spacetime]]; but appears to have dead-ended.

===Original Solution===

Compare the difference in the frame time delta of Juno (vs Bookkeeper) to the frame time delta of Earth (vs Bookkeeper) and then measure the gravitational red/blue shifting of transmissions from Earth to Juno.
<br /><br />

The idea is to use the ratio of the [[Schwarzschild Metric|Schwarzschild metric]] between two frames to describe the curvature of spacetime in the Solar System as a function of the [[Time Dilation|clock tick delta]] as measured in the frame versus the clock tick delta measured at the Bookkeeper (far-away time → flat spacetime).
<br /><br />

This ratio, as done in Queries 1-4 of [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|Project A]], describes the interval between clock ticks measured at the Bookkeeper versus the interval between clock ticks measured in the frame.
<br /><br />
  (dt_BookKeeper)/(dt_(Frame In Question) )
<br />
* A ratio evaluating to 1 indicated that the frame exists in flat spacetime and that the frame is equivalent to the Bookkeeper’s frame.
* A ratio evaluating to less than 1 indicates that the interval between clock ticks is less for the Bookkeeper than for the frame; this is essentially saying that time evolves forward more quickly from the Bookkeeper’s reference frame than for the comparison’s frame.
* A ratio evaluating to greater than 1 indicates that the interval between clock ticks is greater for the Bookkeeper than for the frame. (Negative curvature of spacetime ?)
<br /><br />
We will start with the simplest approximation and build up in complexity. From this, we will assume that we can model Earth, Juno, and Jupiter as all existing in the same plane. In spherical coordinates, this equates to polar coordinates of r and ϕ where θ=0.
We then model each planet as being spherically symmetric and consider each reference frame on Earth and Jupiter at the equator (θ=0). Using the Schwarzschild Metric with polar coordinates, we can begin to discuss the difference in frame time clock ticks as measured between different frames.
