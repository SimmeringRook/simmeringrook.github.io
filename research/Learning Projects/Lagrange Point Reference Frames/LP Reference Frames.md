### Applicable Concepts and Laws
#### Newton's Laws of Motion
Recall that Newton has three laws:

<blockquote>

  1. In an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.

  2. In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces $F$ on an object is equal to the mass $m$ of that object multiplied by the acceleration $a$ of the object: $F = ma$. It is assumed that $m$ is constant.

  3. When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

  </blockquote>

#### Inertial Reference Frame
Recall the definition of an inertial frame of reference is one that:

> A reference frame in which [[Newton's First Law]] is obeyed. Another way to consider this is that there is a net force of 0 acting on the body in the frame. The size of a frame can be arbitrarily sized as long as the initial criteria is maintained. We can then say that objects traveling in these frames are said to have natural motion.


#### Lagrange Point
Recall the definition of a Lagrangian (Lagrange) Point is:

<blockquote>
  In celestial mechanics, the <strong>Lagranian points</strong> are orbital points near two large co-orbiting bodies. At the Lagrangian points, the gravitational forces of the two large bodies cancel out in such a way that a small object placed in orbit there is in equilibrium relative to the center of mass of the large bodies.

  [Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point)
  </blockquote>

#### General Relativity
There is no gravity, it is all curvature of spacetime.

## Solution
### Using Classical Mechanics
#### Trivial Proof
Due to the fact that we can arbitrarily size an inertial reference frame in terms of both space and time, we can consider a test particle that can be modeled as a point located at any of the Lagrange points. For an instant in time, that particle, by definition of its location meets the criteria for two co-orbiting massive objects.
