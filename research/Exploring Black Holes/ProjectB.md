Orbits that stay greater than 300M -> Newtonian Mechanics can be used as a great approximation

# Project B: Inside the Black Hole

Nothing happens at the horizon -> these are coordinate singularities
everything continues to be smooth

There are no rest frames inside the horizon -> no shell can be constructed

Coordinate swap inside the horizon:
  - Nothing physically different occurs
  - r becoming time-like means "free float frame moves to small r with the inevitability that we ordinarily associate with the passage of time"

## Query 1

**Mass of the "20-year black hole":** Our chosen black hole has a mass such that it takes 20 years of wristwatch time for a diver who falls from rest starting from an infinite distance to pass from the horizon to the center.

### Part A:

?> Find the approximate mass of the "20-year black hole":
?> - in meters
?> - as a multiple of the mass of our Sun
?> - and in years

We begin by looking at the energy per unit mass of an in-falling object starting out at infinity, we can use Equation 19 (or the Schwarzschild radial geodesic $\dot{t}$ solved for $e$), either way, we start with the general expression:

$$
\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right) \frac{dt}{d\tau} = 1
$$

Next, we consider the expression for proper time for this in-falling object, using the metric (but simplified for the $\theta=\pi/2$ plane and exploiting $\phi$ symmetry):

$$d\tau^2 = \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right) dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)}$$

We square our first expression, based off the geodesic,
