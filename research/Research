## Timeline
### Spring 2020
Meeting frequency was set to once every two weeks as this term had two concurrent Paradigm courses throughout the 10 weeks. Content covered and discussed during this time was related to Chapter 1 of [[Exploring Black Holes]].
### Summer 2020
Meeting frequency was set to once per week.
; 8 week term
: Pacing of content was slow on my end as I was dealing with burnout from 3 back to back terms with very little break. Content covered during this time moved from Special Relativity to discussion about General Relativity. Chapter 2 was covered from [[Exploring Black Holes]] and work on [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|Project A]] began.

*; 3 Aug 2020
*: We discussed results from queries 1-4 from [[Exploring Black Holes, Project A|Project A]]. An interesting question was brought up about the effects that General Relativity would have on the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter. This was inspired from the immediately apparent effects of GR on a GPS satellite.

*; 10 Aug 2020
*: Discussed issues regarding how to account for the curvature of spacetime at Juno's location from both Earth and Jupiter, simultaneously. My attempts at adding the Schwarzschild metric for both Earth and Jupiter together, as approximated in Queries 1-3 of Project A were unsuccessful. Recommendation to look into Negative Curvature of spacetime and what it means.

; 17 Aug 2020
: No meeting. Work accomplished in preparation for next week:
:* Considered a different approach to the Juno question and may have a answer with [[Gravitational Shifting of Transmissions to Juno#Attempt 2|Attempt 2]].
:* Began reading [[The Geometry of Special Relativity]] to ensure difficulties with the Juno question didn't come from lack of [[Special Relativity]] knowledge. Also began reading this book to prepare for [[PH 335]].
:* In writing up Attempt 2 of the Juno question, I decided to start leveraging the wiki more and use it interconnect concepts as well as a version control and history of content done for research.
:* Started rereading Chapter 1 of [[Exploring Black Holes|EBH]] to compare differences with [[The Geometry of Special Relativity|GSR]]. Also used this opportunity to digitize notes and expand on concepts as pages in the wiki.
