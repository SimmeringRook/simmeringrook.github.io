- Homework discussed circular orbits for time-like and null-like geodesics.

- Mapped notation from Taylor & Wheeler to Tevian:

| Taylor & Wheeler | Tevian |
| --- | --- |
| $dr_{shell}$ | $\sigma^{r}$ |
| $dt_{shell}$ | $\sigma^{t}$ |
| $M$, black hole mass | $m$ |
| $m$, mass of observer | $M$ |
| $\frac{E}{m}$ | $e$ |
| $\frac{L}{m}$ | $\ell$ |
| $\frac{dt}{d\tau}$ | $\dot{t}$ |
