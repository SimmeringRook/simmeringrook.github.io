### Chapter 4

> Hypothesis: A neutrino version of the light-sphere would correspond to a circular orbit of 6M for a Schwarzschild Black Hole.


#### Physical Reasoning:

We use geodesics to describe the worldline for objects that travel in an inertial reference frame. The primary construction of these comes from the metric which only depends on the massive object (in our case, black hole) and not the traveler's mass. We construct the geodesic equations by normalizing the conserved quantities of angular momentum ($L$) and energy ($E$) by dividing by the traveler's mass to obtain expressions that describe change in space with respect to proper time using the parameters of angular momentum and energy 'per unit mass'. Page 4-15 of Taylor and Wheeler show this with equation 30:

$$\underbrace{\left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2}_{\Delta\text{ in space w.r.t.}\\ \text{proper time}} = \underbrace{\left(\frac{E}{m}\right)^2}_{\text{Energy per unit mass}} - \left(1 - \frac{2M}{r}\right) \bigg[1 + \frac{1}{r^2}\underbrace{\left(\frac{L}{m}\right)^2}_{\text{Angular momentum}\\ \text{ per unit mass}}\bigg]$$

From this, Taylor and Wheeler show, in Chapter 4, that the only radial coordinate that exists for a stable circular orbit is $r=6M$, and that the unstable orbit for anything other than light is $4M$. This is done without assuming properties of the traversing object, so it stands to reason that the neutrino-like light-sphere would exist at $r=6M$ (assuming constant size Black Hole and no other interactions to decay each neutrino).

#### Mathematical Reasoning:

If we consider the first derivative of the effective potential function and check what values of the radial coordinate correspond to a critical point (first derivative evaluates to 0), we obtain the following expression (with $M$ set to unity for simplicity[^1]):

[^1]: The first derivative set equal to zero and evaluated for critical points without the visual simplification of $M=1$ takes the form of: $$r^2 = (r-3M)\left(\frac{L}{m}\right)^2$$


$$r^2=(r-3)\left(\frac{L}{m}\right)^2$$

We can find the first critical point by use of a power series approximation: Divide both sides by the angular momentum and solve for the first order of $r$. We can assume safely at this stage, that the particle in question has non-zero orbital angular momentum as we are attempting to find what value of (unit) angular momentum is required for a particle to obtain/maintain a circular orbit. If the particle has no angular momentum, then it will not be possible to obtain a circular orbit about the Black Hole and will only plunge directly into the singularity.

$$r = 3 + \left(\frac{r}{\frac{L}{m}}\right)^2 \approx 3$$

Noting that as $r\rightarrow 3M$, $L/m$ must grow proportionally such that the second term vanishes, and so in the extreme limit, we find a circular orbit is possible if the particle could obtain an orbital angular momentum that approaches infinity. This solution is obtainable for only the null-geodesic after we rework the effective potential expression such that a ratio[^2] of angular momentum to linear momentum is expressed. As we let the mass of the particle for that geodesic approach zero, the impact parameter for light is given and then a finite value of

[^2]: Also known as the "impact parameter", $b=L/E$
