# Review of 'Observables of spheroidal magnetized Strange Stars'

## Summary

### Background

Astrophysicists have a good understanding of the overview for the life of a star. Areas of interest and uncertainty currently focus on the formation of a star and the exotic end stages. The main stages of stellar evolution are divided (loosely) into the following sections:

1. Early
    - This covers the time period from the condensing of gas, most likely from a nebula, into the formation of a protostar and ultimately into a [Main Sequence Stars](link.html). The central discriminating feature of Main sequence stars are that they are primarily using Hydrogen to fuel the nuclear fusion occurring in the core. The Sun is still well within the hydrogen stage and is our local main sequence star.
2. Post-Main Sequence
    - As the hydrogen fuel begins to run out, this is the period where the mass (size) of the star starts to dramatically differentiate its life from the paths of others. As the hydrogen core is exhausted, these stars expand as the hydrogen above the now helium core feeds the fusion and the star transitions into a Red giant.
3. Late
    - There are a few branching paths that more massive stars can take as they either switch to different fuel sources for fusion. Stars that are not primarily convective can experience periods of instability as easier to fuse material is cycled internally causing the star to flare and flash, ejecting some of its stellar material (one form of creating a nebula).
    - Other stars that live through this process ultimately run into the problem where silicon is fused into iron. Iron is a big problem for stars as the process requires energy, instead of producing energy. As the iron core grows, the star will eventually collapse producing a supernova. The explosion ejects the outer layers of the star and reveals the remnant of the core which is either a form of Neutron star or a Black Hole.

The main focus of this paper is on the area of expanding our description and understanding of Neutron stars (NSs) and their cores. Neutron stars are primarily composed of their namesake: neutrons. Not only is a star comprised *solely* of subatomic particles interesting, but this extreme system requires the combination of some intense[^-1] fields of Physics :

- General Relativity: because while extremely small and compact, the star has enough mass to curve spacetime.
- Statistical Mechanics: degenerate neutron matter and strange quark matter can't be reasonably described by Classical Thermodynamics (in comparison to Main Sequence stars).
- Quantum Mechanics (and Quantum Chromodynamics): to model and begin to describe the energy of a system comprised of quarks (elementary particles that make up the three subatomic particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons).

[-1]: By "intense", I refer to need for something beyond Classical Mechanics. Normally, we can still approximate other features of a system with Newtonian Mechanics, but in this case, we need to replace each major portion of a Classical description for the problem with its corresponding modern counterpart.

### Why do we care about 'Strange Stars'?

Strange Stars are a sub-classification on Neutron Stars. Under the extreme pressures and intensities that exist inside Neutron Stars, we suppose that the core consists not of subatomic particles, but [Strange Matter](link.html) (SM or SQM for 'Strange Quark Matter'): [quarks](link.html) that come from the decomposed hadronic matter (neutrons). The study of quarks are of great interest in our path to understanding the minute building blocks that combine in masses to create the grand structures of life and the properties of our Universe.

The study of Neutron Stars has renewed with increased interest over the past decade, as another sub-classification has promisingly offered an alternative (and concurrent) method of visualizing and recording Gravitational Waves: Pulsars. A prime example of this research can be seen by [NANOGrav's](http://nanograv.org/) work with the [Pulsar Timing Array](http://www.ipta4gw.org/), which has a local presence at Oregon State University through the work done by Dr. Xavier Siemens.

### What's so interesting about this paper?

The authors of this paper make tremendous effort forward in deriving Equations of State (EoS) for these Strange Stars (SSs). What is notable about this physical system is that there are no solutions that provide the EoS for these SSs: either using exact calculations or perturbation theory in [Quantum Chromodynamics](link.html).

Previous attempts to derive equations of state for magnetized Strange Stars arrive at two independent pressure equations. The independence of these equations prevent a coherent description of the macroscopic star and are highly dependent on the model.

This attempt uses the same concept as a launching point but derives a variation similar to the [Tolman-Oppenhimer-Volkoff](link.html) (TOV) equations by starting with an [axially symmetric metric](link.html) in spherical coordinates. These equations combine coherently to accurately describe observed properties of highly magnetized Neutron stars.

While these results are promising, they are not the end; they only offer a promising path forward, as the equations are still very model dependent.

## The Physics of this Paper

There are four major topics of Physics present in this paper:

1. Thermodynamics (and Statisical Mechanics)
2. Quantum Mechanics
3. General Relativity
4. Nuclear Physics

### Astrophyics

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova

<br />

### Nuclear Physics

- We're talking about a star that is made up of decomposed subatomic particles
  - quarks make up the subatomic particles
  - cores of SSs are proposed to be comprised of quarks
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark


<br />

### Thermodynamics: Macroscopic and Microscopic

- (Stable) Stars need to be in stellar equilibrium: if they are not, they will evolve to reach what will be the new equilibrium.
  - this is what describes stellar evolution
- Equations of State let us discuss how changes of properties change the rest of the system
- We need Statisical Mechanics to describe the Microscopic contributions to the two separate pressure differentials.

<br />

### Quantum Mechanics

- We describe (and limit) the energy of the quarks by using a model similar to *particle in a box*
  - MIT-Bag Model
  - quasi-free particles but with binding energy
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics

<br />

### General Relativity

- Need a metric that describes the physical situation more than the idealization
- Axial symmetry, not spherical
