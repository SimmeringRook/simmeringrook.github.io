# Neutron Stars

In brief:
Neutron Stars are the leftover core of a star after its stellar collapse. Stars with a mass of at least **value** leave behind a core of densely packed neutrons.
aftereffect of stars (with mass greater than **value**) that continue to compress as they run out of fuel. At the point shortly before creation, the gravitational force tips the scales and begins to compress the star. The stellar material continues to squeeze closer together until we enter the real of Quantum Mechanical effects: The pressure that begins to resist the gravitational force is Electron-degeneracy pressure.
>
> Ultimately, this pressure is overcome and electrons and protons merge to create neutrons. A stable Neutron star is one where the Neutron-degeneracy pressure and strong force counteract gravity to bring the star back into stable equilibrium.
