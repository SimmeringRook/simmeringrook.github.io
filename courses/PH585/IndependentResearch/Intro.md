Neutron Stars (NSs)

- core:
  - "densities beyond that of nuclear saturation"
- hadronic to Strange Quark Matter (SQM)
  - hadronic -> hydrogenic?
  - SQM is the true ground state of strong-interacting matter
    - Bodmer-Witten's conjecture
- subclasses
  - differentiated by how strong interaction and phases of SQM
  1. Strange Stars (SSs)
      - SQM
      - describe compact objects with maximum mass 1.5 Solar Mass
      - 4-8km radius
      - could account from observations of cold, dense, and small Compact Objects (COs)
  2. Hybrid Stars (HSs)
      - core of SQM, layer of hadrons
      - mass can reach 2 Solar Masses
        - 2 Solar Mass is a constraint on NS mass
      - recent theoretical and experimental support for models
        - Eemeli Annala et al. (13)
        - combines Equations of State from particle and nuclear physics and results from Gravitational Wave measurements of NSs collisions
        - a star with ~2 Solar Mass and radius of ~ 12 km is *more likely* to have a quark core of approximately 6.5 km *than to be* formed exclusively by baryons

SQM

- Quark-gluon plasma
  - high temperature, low density
  - Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)
  - Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN
- opposite regime
  - low temperature, high densities
    - Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at GSI
    - Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility (NICA) at JINR
  - NS cores might be the natural habitat for SQM in this regime
    - properties could be inferred through astronomical observations
- Equation of State (EoS)
  - quarks might be unpaired or paired
    - color superconductor state
  - No *ab initio* or perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) calculations for the desired EoS in the regime of high densities and zero temperature.
  - SQM inside of COs is usually described through models that mimic main features of QCD
    - MIT-Bag model
      - quarks are considered as quasi-free particles confined into a "bag" with fixed masses.
      - reproduces confinement and asymptotic freedom using one external parameter, the bag energy $B_{Bag}$

COs

- extreme magnetic fields
  - observed surface fields are in the range of $10^9 - 10^{15}\ G$
    - internal fields estimated to be $5\times 10^{18}\ G$
  - energy momentum tensor of matter is **anisotropic**
    - gas exerting different pressures (parallel and perpendicular with respect to magnetic axis)
    - leads to non-spherical stars

Previous Models

- use TOV equations for each pressure (parallel vs perpendicular)
  - Tolman-Oppenhimer-Volkoff (TOV)
- approximate solution to Einstein's equations for an axially symmetric metric in cylindrical coordinates
- two different stellar sequences
  - one for each pressure
  - prevents a calculation of the total mass of the star

This Model

- derived TOV-like structure equations ($\gamma$ equations)
  - axially symmetric metric
  - spherical coordinates
- describe spheroidal objects
  - as long as shape is "nearly spherical"
- used on
  - White Dwarfs
  - (hypothetical) magnetized BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate) stars
  - Strange Stars (SSs)

    - bag energy
    - magnetic field
- uses new model to calculate and compare to observed data
  - mass
  - eccentricity
  - redshift
- revisit magnetized EoS for SSs
  - magnetic field effects on energy density and pressures
