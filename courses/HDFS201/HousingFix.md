## 1) Summary

The report investigates the compounding hardship of low-income housing using West and South Dallas as a case study. At risk of oversimplifying the issue, the report exposes the fundamental problem for the tenants of these low-income rentals: they have no other choice but all of the problems.. The landlord, Khraish Khraish, and his father originally purchased 400 homes and 100 commercial properties from a previous family business that had accumulated "over a million dollars of liens and back taxes" from code citations. Khraish faced backlash from tenants and the city for not fixing the violations, but from his view it would bankrupt him. Faced with continued fines for code violations for properties built in the 1930s, he only saw two options: demolish the property or shift the problem. Tenants that refuse to purchase their property from Khraish are evicted and those that agree become the target of code enforcement by the city. The city doesn't want to build any affordable housing and so the tenants are left holding the bag: no where to go and soon, no home to live in.

## 2) According to the report, who is responsible to maintain affordable and decent housing for low-income families (e.g., the tenants, the landlord, the local Housing Authority, etc.)?

The landlord is supposed to ensure that the property is up to code, such that tenants can reside in decent housing and the city attorney enforces these standards through litigation and property inspections. Ultimately though, the city has control over land use planning and zoning to establish areas of affordable housing, but in the case of West Dallas, that is not happening. New housing being developed in the region, but it starts at three times the rate Khraish charges.

## 3) What solutions did the report propose regarding providing affordable housing for low-income families? What solutions would you propose? 

The report doesn't offer any normative prescriptions on how to solve the problem. I don't have a silver bullet either, but between this report and the article *Severe Deprivation* by Mathew Desmond[^-1] (from the Deep Dive 2A assignment), I can say its more complicated than just zoning affordable housing. That said, at least giving residents the option to move to a different location in the city that is affordable, would at least alleviate some of the pressure.

As a result, I think the city of Dallas failed its residents on multiple levels. First, the aforementioned lack of more affordable housing is going to ultimately force these tenants into homelessness as they either lose their right to reside in the property due to the city condemning the houses or through unfixable code violations. Second, they blindly applied policy without concern for the possible result and only considered the ideal outcome: Khraish will fix the problems or lose money to fines. To be clear, I'm not advocating for the city to avoid inspections and code violations; but approaching one of the few landlords offering affordable housing in the city with a stack of violations that would cause bankruptcy (assuming good faith in Khraish's statement) can really only end one way. If the city doesn't want to work with the landlord to bring properties built before building codes were established up to code due to the cost involved, I'm not sure I understand how they thought he would.

On one hand, I side with Melissa Miles (assistant city attorney), in that Khraish should have accounting for this when purchasing the properties from the previous family, but I don't see how this would've played out any differently if the other family's company went bankrupt. The properties would be forfeit to either the city or banks and this whole process would have started earlier. The city just gets to keep the appearance of keeping their hands clean except for the glaring exception where they knew this was an inevitable problem and has not taken any proactive action in mitigating the effects on their residents.

In conclusion, my solution for this problem is that we need to further the work started by Mathew Desmond to truly resolve this problem and for the city of Dallas to very quickly zone and subsidize (if needed) affordable housing. Ideally, this zoning will take into account access to the key institutions Desmond talks about to prevent any further compounding of the problem. At the very least, we need to do literally anything beyond passing the issue onto someone else, because right now, the ones holding the bag are now expected to fix it.
