### 1) The US is sometimes called the “richest nation in the world,” and ranked among the top 15 wealthiest nations in the world in 2018 according to the IMF. But, Desmond (2015) asserts that “[n]o rich democracy matches the United States in the depth and expanse of its poverty.” Based on the reading, describe how the US compares to other wealthy nations in terms of the 1) depth (2.5 points) and 2) expanse (2.5 points) of poverty rates. 

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
On page 3 of the article, Desmond (2015) states that "almost 50 million Americans lived below the federal poverty line" and that number eclipses the population of Spain. The federal poverty line sets the income threshold based off the combined annual income of a family of four (two parents and two children) at \$25,465 (Cohen 2021, 134). The important aspect of this threshold is that it is the upper bound on an interval and requires at least two further categories to describe the disparity in living conditions/quality of life for some of these 50 million Americans: deep poverty (at least half of the \$25.5k) and extreme poverty (on the order of \$2 a day) (Desmond 2015, p. 2). 50 million people, of the 332.6 million (US Census), or 15\% of the United States' population must find a way to live on anywhere from \$2 a day to less than \$25,465 a year.

### 2) In your own words, define and explain “compounded hardship” (1 point). Also, describe two examples of compounded hardship (2 points each).

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
A compounded hardship refers to a hardship being the result of multiple factors. Using Crystal as an example, she faces adversity with respect to homelessness not just due to her past eviction record (Desmond 2015, p. 1) but also as a (not exhaustive) combination of childhood trauma, loss of SSI eligibility (Desmond 2015, p. 2), and an income of just \$25 a day (Desmond 2015, p. 3). Another example of compounding hardship is represented by homelessness itself. To obtain a photo ID (or driver's license), you need to at least provide some proof of being a resident in that state. While each state varies in their specific requirements (more/less restrictive), state residency is usually established by providing a utility or other billing statement with the address listed. The compounding portion of this process comes from this cyclic dependency where employers and/or governmental programs require some photo identification to participate in their processes. Thus, someone who has been homeless for too long and has their ID expire can be stuck in limbo: unable to get employed without an ID, which in turn prevents them from having income in order to establish residency to obtain state ID.
\end{spacing}

### 3) In the section “A New Poverty Agenda,” Desmond (2015) asserts that the nature of contemporary poverty in the US has changed, especially that of extreme poverty. List and describe three specific examples of the ways in which the nature of extreme poverty has changed over the last three to four decades.

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
Over the past three-four decades, poverty has changed with respect to the type of aid, stagnation and downward trend of the labor market, and the location of the impoverished. On page 8, Desmond (2015) details how state and federal assistance programs have narrowed their focus to those near the poverty threshold and away from those in the deep and extreme poverty categories, resulting in a growing divide between the working and nonworking poor. The article then goes on to highlight how changes to the labor market, namely the service industry eclipsing manufacturing and other union protected jobs, has left the bottom wage earners in worse conditions: low pay, no benefits, and schedule unpredictability. Finally, the rise of suburbs has created a new set of hardships for these workers, as they no longer have close or easy access to key institutions that inner city proximity offers. Their dislocation also imposes an increased hardship of requiring additional income to afford transportation to work, stores, hospitals, schools, etc. (Desmond 2015, p. 6).
\end{spacing}

### 4) The author asserts that the US poverty research and policy agenda needs to “look squarely at the trauma of poverty, its sadness, without reducing people to their hardship alone” (Desmond, 2015, p. 9). Then, in the last few paragraphs of the article, Desmond provides an anecdote of a woman showing compassion and generosity to a boy experiencing hunger, despite experiencing poverty and adversity herself. How might the ideas conveyed in the statement and quote above be applied to potential 1) US poverty research (2.5 points), and 2) policy agenda (2.5 points)?

\begin{spacing}{1.5}
In the earlier section, "A Challenge", Desmond details how previous research in the area of poverty has only considered single factors of hardship and analyzed how to relieve it with respect to helping those in poverty. While Desmond doesn't discount this research, they do argue about the field and policymakers *missing the forest for the trees*. For some, if the hardship is acute and not yet compounding, treating this diagnosed symptom may help them recover beyond poverty. For others, like Crystal, I believe Desmond argues that there is not just one aspect of her life that you could improve with policy or direct intervention (kindness of strangers) that will resolve her hardships. This is encapsulated perfectly in Desmond's anecdote of Crystal and Vanetta paying for the boy's meal: his immediate concern of hunger is alleviated for the moment, but he is not *fixed* (Desmond 2015, p. 9). The deep and extremely impoverished need help on multiple fronts, and US poverty research needs to account for Desmond's "Severe Deprivation" if any future policy is going to meaningfully support these citizens.
