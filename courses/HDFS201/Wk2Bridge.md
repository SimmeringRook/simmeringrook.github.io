### 1. Look at the options for the 2010 US Census categories for race/ethnicity. The available categories are White, Black, Other, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Non-Hispanic Ethnicity. What would you have answered as your race/ethnicity for the 2010 Census?

White.

### 2. Look at the categories for the 1980 form. What would you have answered as your race/ethnicity for the 1980 Census? What do you notice about the categories for Hawaiian/Pacific Islander?

White. While there was no specific "Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" category for the 1980 census, there were some options:

- Hawaiian
- Samoan
- Guamanian

Interestingly, compared to 2020, "Guamanian" doesn't seem to be a choice anymore. I'm not sure if that's because its been wrapped up inside Samoan, or if it had been so low that it became classified under "Other Pacific Islander".

### 3. Go to the 1960 options. What would you have answered as your race/ethnicity for the 1960 Census? What do you notice about the option “Some other race,” or “other?”

White. There is no option to choose any category that is not listed.

### 4. Consider the 1900 options. Would your answer from the 2010 Census form still be an option on the 1900 Census form?

Yes.

### 5. Lastly, look at the options for the 1840 Census form. What options are on the form? What would have been your race/ethnicity in 1840?

- Free white males, Free white females
- Free colored males and females
- Slaves

I'm not sure if the origin of my family surname had immigrated by this point, but if they did: Free white male

### 6. After looking at the categories for the years 2010, 1980, 1960, 1900, and 1840, name three observations you can make about how categories of race according to the US Census have changed over time.

Somewhat unsurprising, the categories get more restrictive as we look at older the older censuses. I did find it interesting that there's an apparent distinction between male or female on the 1840 form. While not specifically asked about, I do find it interesting that "Other" was introduced in 1910, but remove for 1960 before being reintroduced for the following census. Similarly, in 1930, "Mexican" is added as an option, but then was not possible to choose anything resembling Hispanic until 1970.

Also, as mentioned for Question 2, it seems that Guamanian makes a return in 2010, but then is absent for 2020. I'm curious as to its fluctuating presence.
