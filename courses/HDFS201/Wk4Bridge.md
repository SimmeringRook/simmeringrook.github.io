1. https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mos-eisley-cantina-75290
2. The toy is predominately tan coloured with the primary function being construction (building the set) and the secondary function being to play with it (act out scenes from the movie or imagination).
3. No people (or kids) are shown playing with the toy and I'm not sure of what gender roles the toy would reinforce in home/work/social interactions. At most, the human characters featured are all male presenting. The kid playing with the toy would develop spatial reasoning (from following the instructions) and creativity as they either act out scenes from the corresponding movie or develop their own story using the completed set as a backdrop.
4. In general, it appears that the products of https://mathsgear.co.uk/ are gender neutral. In particular, this puzzle mug (https://mathsgear.co.uk/products/utilities-puzzle-mug) would develop a kid's spatial reasoning and critical thinking/problem solving abilities. The toy challenges gendered roles indirectly by encouraging math related skills/knowledge, which furthers the movement of encouraging women to pursue STEM fields (if interested).
