> Consider a system whose initial state at $t_0=0$ is given in terms of eigenvectors of the (time-independent) Hamiltonian as follows: $$\ket{\psi(0)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\varphi_1} + \frac{1}{2}\ket{\varphi_2} - \frac{1}{2}\ket{\varphi_3}$$

# Question 1

> If the energies corresponding to $\ket{\varphi_1}$, $\ket{\varphi_2}$, and $\ket{\varphi_3}$, are $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$, respectively, what is the state of the system at $\ket{\psi(t)}$ at any later time $t$?

Time evolution of a state is equivalent to multiplying by a complex phase; recall, in general, $$\ket{\psi(t)} = \sum_{n}{c_n e^{-\frac{i E_n}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_n}}$$

And so, $\ket{\psi(t)}$ takes the form:

$$\ket{\psi(t)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-\frac{i E_1}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_1} + \frac{1}{2}e^{-\frac{i E_2}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_2} - \frac{1}{2}e^{-\frac{i E_3}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_3}$$

# Question 2

> How is the average energy at $t=0$ compared to that at a later time $t$? Explain.

$$\begin{aligned}
\bra{\psi(t=0)}H\ket{\psi(t=0)} &= \bra{\psi(t=0)} \bigg(\frac{E_1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\varphi_1} + \frac{E_2}{2}\ket{\varphi_2} - \frac{E_3}{2}\ket{\varphi_3}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{E_1}{2} + \frac{E_2}{4} - \frac{E_3}{4}
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\bra{\psi(t)}H\ket{\psi(t)} &= \bra{\psi(t)} \bigg(\frac{E_1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-\frac{i E_1}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_1} + \frac{E_2}{2}e^{-\frac{i E_2}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_2} - \frac{E_3}{2}e^{-\frac{i E_3}{\hbar}t}\ket{\varphi_3}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{E_1}{2} + \frac{E_2}{4} - \frac{E_3}{4}
\end{aligned}$$

The average energy at any later time $t$ is the same as that average energy at $t_0=0$ due to conservation of energy. It's not until we measure $\ket{\psi(t)}$ that the state is changed and from that time onward, the average energy measured at a later time, $t_{late}$, would diverge from the average energy of the unmeasured state.
