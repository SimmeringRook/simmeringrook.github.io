$$\ $$

As you remember, the original Stern-Gerlach experiment was performed with neutral silver atoms.

# Question 1

> Can one do it with neutral hydrogen atoms? If yes, in what state and why? $$\ $$

It is possible to conduct the original Stern-Gerlach experiment with neutral hydrogen atoms as the total charge is neutral. This means that any change of path for the hydrogen atom, from its contact with the inhomogeneous magnetic field, will result from the spin of the electron.

To mimic the parameters of the original experiment, the state of the hydrogen atom needs to be in the ground state to ensure that there is no orbital angular momentum ($\vec{L}=0$) affecting the results. The easiest way to ensure the electron is not occupying a $p$-orbital is to use hydrogen atoms in the ground state.

$$\ $$

# Question 2

> Can one do it with protons instead of neutral atoms? Why? $$\ $$

As stated above, since the proton is not neutral like a hydrogen atom, the positively charged particle will experience the Lorentz force as it traverses the magnetic field. This would require changes to the experiment to accommodate the effects which breaks the parameters of conducting the 'original' Stern-Gerlach experiment.
