> - infrared
- X-ray
- visible
- ultraviolet

<br />

<hr>

# Question 4

?> The laser used in CD players to read the disk uses an energy of $2.55\times 10^{-19}\ J/photon$. What is the wavelength of light utilized by this laser?

<br />

# Question 5

?> What species is represented by the following information? $$p^+=47 \qquad n^\circ=62 \qquad e^-=46$$

$$\,_{47}^{109} Ag^{1-}$$

<br />

# Question 6

?> Calculate the atomic mass of element "X", if it has 2 naturally occurring isotopes with the following masses and natural abundances. $$\begin{aligned} \text{X-107} &\quad 106.90509\text{ amu} & 51.84\%\\ \text{X-109} &\quad 108.90476\text{ amu} & 48.46\% \end{aligned}$$

$$(106.90509\text{ amu})(0.5184) + (108.90476\text{ amu})(0.4846) = 108.2\text{ amu}$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 7

?> Silver has an atomic mass of $107.868$ amu. The Ag-$109$ isotope ($108.905$ amu) is $48.161\%$. What is the amu of the other isotope?

$$m = \frac{107.868\text{ amu}-(108.905\text{ amu})(0.48161)}{1-0.48161} = 107.52\text{ amu}$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 8

?> Calculate the atomic mass of magnesium, if magnesium has 3 naturally occurring stable isotopes with the following masses and natural abundances: $$\begin{aligned} \text{Mg-24} &\quad 23.9996\text{ amu} & 78.99\%\\ \text{Mg-25} &\quad 24.9858\text{ amu} & 10.00\%\\ \text{Mg-26} &\quad 25.9826\text{ amu} & 11.01\% \end{aligned}$$

$$24.32\text{ amu} = (23.9996\text{ amu})(0.7899) + (24.9858\text{ amu})(0.1000) + (25.9826\text{ amu})(0.1101)$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 9

?> What mass (in $g$) does 2.52 moles of nickel have?

$$2.52\ moles \cdot \frac{58.69\ g}{mol} = 148\ g$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 10

?> How many moles of iron (Fe) are contained in $562$ kg of Fe?

$$562\ kg \cdot \frac{10^3\ g}{kg}\cdot \frac{mol}{55.85\ g} = 1.01\times 10^4\ mol$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 11

?> How many iron (Fe) atoms are contained in $562$ kg of Fe?

$$1.01\times 10^4\ mol \cdot \frac{6.022\times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}}{mol} = 6.06\times 10^{27} \text{ atoms}$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 12

?> Calculate the mass (in mg) of $4.82\times 10^{22}$ atoms of sodium.

$$4.82\times 10^{22} \text{ atoms} \cdot \frac{mol}{6.022\times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}}\cdot\frac{22.99\ g}{mol}\cdot \frac{1\ mg}{10^{-3}\ g} = 1.84\times 10^{3}\ mg$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 13


?> Which of the following contains the **most** atoms? (You shouldn't need to do a calculation here.)

> - $10.0$ g Al
> - $10.0$ g He
> - $10.0$ g Ca
> - $10.0$ g Kr
> - $10.0$ g Cs

# Question 14

?> How many atoms are in $2.50$ moles of $SiO_2$?

$$2.50\ mol\ SiO_2 \cdot \frac{6.022\times 10^{23} \text{ molecules}}{mol}\cdot\frac{3 \text{ atoms}}{1\ SiO_2\ molecule} = 4.52\times 10^{24}\text{ atoms}$$
