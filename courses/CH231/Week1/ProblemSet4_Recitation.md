# Question 5

?> An electron transitions from level $n=6$ to a lower energy level. The wavelength corresponding to the transition is equal to $7.460\times 10^3\ nm$. What energy level did the electron transition to?

$$\begin{aligned}
-E_{photon} &= (-2.18\times 10^{-18}\ J) \left(\frac{1}{{n_f}^2} - \frac{1}{{n_i}^2}\right) \\
\frac{E_{photon}}{2.18\times 10^{-18}\ J} &= \left(\frac{1}{{n_f}^2} - \frac{1}{{n_i}^2}\right)\\
\\
\frac{1}{{n_f}^2} &= \frac{1}{{n_i}^2} + \frac{E_{photon}}{2.18\times 10^{-18}\ J} \\
&= \frac{(2.18\times 10^{-18}\ J)+{n_i}^2E_{photon}}{{n_i}^2(2.18\times 10^{-18}\ J)}\\
\\
n_f = 5
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 6

?> The uncertainty in the momentum of a football is $1\times 10^{-6}$ of its total momentum. If the football is traveling at $40\ m/s$ and weighs $0.40\ kg$, what is the uncertainty in its position?

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta x &\geq \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta p} \\
&\geq \frac{6.626\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s}{4\pi (1\times 10^{-6})(0.40\ kg)(40\ m/s)}\\
&\geq 3\times 10^{-30}\ m
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 7

?> An atom in an excited state temporarily stores energy. If the uncertainty in the lifetime of the excited state is $1.0\times 10^{-10}\ s$, what is the uncertainty in the energy of the state?

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta t \Delta E &\geq \frac{h}{4\pi}\\
\Delta E &\geq \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta t} \\
&\geq 5.3\times 10^{-25}\ J
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 8

?> Consider a proton moving at $1\%$ the speed of light. If the uncertainty in its velocity is $5.0\%$ of its speed, what is the uncertainty in its position?

$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta x &\geq \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta p} \\
&\geq \frac{6.626\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s}{4\pi (0.05)(1.672\times 10^{-27}\ kg)(3.00\times 10^{6}\ m/s)}\\
