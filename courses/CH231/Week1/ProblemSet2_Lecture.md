# Question 1: Mass-to-Charge

Imagine a unit of charge called the *zorg*. A chemist performs the oil-drop experiment and measures the charge of each drop in zorgs.

| Trial | Charge (zorgs) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | $-4.8\times 10^{-12}$ |
| 2 | $-9.6\times 10^{-12}$ |
| 3 | $-6.4\times 10^{-12}$ |
| 4 | $-1.3\times 10^{-11}$ |

## Part A

?> Based on the results, what is the charge of the electron in zorgs?

Ratio: 4.8:9.6:6.4 -> 3:6:4

$-1.6\times10^{-12}$ Zorgs : 1 electron

<br />

## Part B

?> How many electrons are in each of the drops that were measured?

3, 6, 4, 8

<br />

## Part C

?> What is the numerical value (in Coulombs) of a zorg?

Recall the charge of an electron is $1.60\times 10^{-19}\ C$.

$$\begin{aligned}
-1.6*10^-12\text{\ Zorgs} &: 1.60\times 10^{-19}\ C\\
1\text{\ Zorg} : 1\times 10^{-7}\ C
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 2: Law of Conservation of Mass

?> Your ten-year-old niece wants to learn some chemistry. You decide to teach her about the law of conservation of mass. "Matter cannot be created or destroyed" you tell her. To show her this, you take $1.00$ g of pure copper powder, weigh it, arrange it in a variety of shapes, and shower her that the mass does not change. You then heat it over a flame for a few minutes and, to your surprise, you find that it then weighs $1.25$ g. To save face, explain what happened, and why the results doesn't violate the law of conservation of mass.

From [Question 14](/courses/CH231/Week1/ProblemSet_Chapter1#Question-14.md):

>Chemical reactions cause a substance to change by either altering the state of the substance (boiling water: liquid $\rightarrow$ gas) or through changing the bonds of the comprising elements. The compounds and elements are either breaking apart ($H_2O\rightarrow2H+0$) or bonding together ($2Cu+0_2\rightarrow 2CuO$). These elements have to come from the surrounding system: we cannot heat copper powder in a vacuum (no oxygen) and create Copper oxide; we can seal copper power in a container with oxygen and remove all the oxygen through synthesizing copper oxide, but the resulting mass of the copper oxide will be equal to the sum of the initial masses.

The best approach would be to repeat this demonstration but with the $1.00$ g of pure copper powder inside a vacuum. After rearranging and heating, we will see that the mass stays the same, and so we come to the logical conclusion that the Law is correct and that in the first demonstration, some of the atoms in the air bonded with the copper.

# Question 3: Law of Multiple Proportions

?> The following data was collected for different compounds of nitrogen and oxygen. Show how this data illustrates the Law of Multiple Proportions.

| Compound | Mass of Nitrogen (in g) that combines with $1.0000$ g Oxygen |
| --- | --- |
| A | $1.750$ |
| B | $0.8750$ |
| C | $0.4375$ |

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{Compound A}}{\text{Compound B}} &= \frac{1.750}{0.8750} = 2 \\
\frac{\text{Compound A}}{\text{Compound C}} &= \frac{1.750}{0.4375} = 4 \\
\frac{\text{Compound B}}{\text{Compound C}} &= \frac{0.8750}{0.4375} = 2 \\
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 4: Dimensional Analysis

?> Using concepts from Chapter 1, come up with an estimate of the number of atoms in the universe. You may make the following assumptions:

> - All of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms
- The Sun is a typical star composed of pure hydrogen with a density of $1.4\ g/cm^3$ and a radius of $7\times 10^8\ m$.
- Each of the roughly $100$ billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy contain the same number of atoms as our Sun.
- Each of the $10$ billion galaxies in the visible universe contain the same number of atoms as our galaxy.

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{star}} &= \frac{1.4\ g}{cm^3}\cdot\frac{cm^3}{10^{-6}\ m^3}\cdot\frac{4\pi(7\times10^8\ m)^3}{3}\cdot\frac{6.022\times10^{23} \text{ atoms}}{1.008\ g}\\
&= \frac{1.4(4\pi)(7^3)(6.022)}{3(1.008)} \times (10^6\cdot 10^{24}\cdot 10^{23}) \frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{star}}\\
\\
\frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{universe}} &= \frac{10^{10}\text{ galaxies}}{\text{universe}}\cdot \frac{10^{11} \text{stars}}{\text{galaxy}}\cdot x\frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{star}}\\
&= \frac{1.4(4\pi)(7^3)(6.022)}{3(1.008)} \times 10^{72} \frac{\text{atoms}}{\text{universe}}\\
\\
&\approx 2\times 10^{75} \text{ atoms}
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 5: Chemical Symbols

?> Write the chemical symbol for the isotope of radium, $Ra$, that has $138$ neutrons.

$$\,_{88}^{226} Ra $$

# Question 6: Converting Mass to Number of Atoms

?> How many atoms are there in a $15.3\ g$ sample of sodium, $Na$?

$$(15.3\ g) \left( \frac{1\ mol}{22.99\ g} \cdot \frac{6.022\times 10^{23}\text{ atoms}}{1\ mol} \right) = 4.01\times 10^{23}\text{ atoms}$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 7: Converting Moles to Mass

?> What is the mass of $3.0\times 10^{-9}\ mol$ xenon, $Xe$?

$$(3.0\times 10^{-9}\ mol) \left( \frac{131.293\ g}{1\ mol} \right) = 3.9\times 10^{-7}\ g$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 8: Converting Mass to Moles

?> How many moles of aluminum, $Al$, are there in a typical aluminum can ($13\ g$)?

$$ (13\ g) \left(\frac{mol}{26.98\ g}\right) = 0.48\ moles$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 9: Atomic Mass Units

?> What is the mass of a single atom of $Ne$?

$$\frac{20.18\ g}{mol} \cdot \frac{mol}{6.022\times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}} = 3.351\times 10^{-23}\ g$$

<br />

# Question 10: Average Mass of an Element

?> A fictitious element, $Fi$, has three naturally occurring isotopes with the masses and $\%$ abundances given here: $$\begin{aligned} Fi\text{-}31 & \quad 30.875\text{ amu} & 13.6\%\\ Fi\text{-}33 & \quad 32.954\text{ amu} & 43.0\%\\ Fi\text{-}34 & \quad 33.919\text{ amu} & 43.4\%\end{aligned}$$ What is the average atomic mass of $Fi$?

We simply scale each isotope's mass by its abundance and sum them:

$$(30.875\text{ amu})(0.136) + (32.954\text{ amu})(0.430) + (33.919\text{ amu})(0.434) = 33.090\text{ amu}$$

<br />

# Question 11: Abundance of Isotopes from Average Mass

?> Another fake element, $Fk$, has an average atomic mass of $115.2\text{ amu}$, and also has three naturally occurring isotopes. Their masses and one of the $\%$ abundances are given below. Find the two missing abundances. $$\begin{aligned} Fk\text{-}113 & \quad 112.65\text{ amu} & 21.8\%\\ Fk\text{-}115 & \quad 114.82\text{ amu} & \,\\ Fk\text{-}118 & \quad 117.32\text{ amu} & \,\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
x+y+0.218 &= 1\\
y &= 0.782 - x\\
\\
112.65(0.218) + 114.82x + 117.32(y) &= 115.2\\
114.82x + 117.32(0.782 - x) &= 115.2 - 112.65(0.218)\\
(114.82 - 117.32)x &= 115.2 - 112.65(0.218) - 117.32(0.782)\\
x &= \frac{115.2 - 112.65(0.218) - 117.32(0.782)}{(114.82 - 117.32)}\\
&= 0.440776\\
\\
y &= 0.782 - 0.440776\\
&= 0.341224
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the natural abundances of the two isotopes are: $44.07\%$ ($Fk\text{-}115$) and $34.12\%$ ($Fk\text{-}118$).
