## Question 6

?> Explain the differences between an element and a compound.

An element is a substance that cannot be reduced any further (atomically) and is comprised of a single type of atom. A compound is a substance that is comprised of at least two different elements in fixed ratios (Law of Definite Proportions).

For example, Hydrogen is an element and $H_2O$ (water) is a compound comprised of 2 elements at a fixed ratio:  2 Hydrogen atoms to 1 Oxygen atom.

<br />

## Question 14

?> State and explain the law of conservation of mass.

> "In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed."

Chemical reactions cause a substance to change by either altering the state of the substance (boiling water: liquid $\rightarrow$ gas) or through changing the bonds of the comprising elements. The compounds and elements are either breaking apart ($H_2O\rightarrow$2H+0$) or bonding together ($2Cu+0_2\rightarrow 2CuO$). These elements have to come from the surrounding system: we cannot heat copper powder in a vacuum (no oxygen) and create Copper oxide; we can seal copper power in a container with oxygen and remove all the oxygen through synthesizing copper oxide, but the resulting mass of the copper oxide will be equal to the sum of the initial masses.

<br />

## Question 15

?> State and explain the law of definite proportions.

> "All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their constituent elements."

This is basically the definition for a compound. We define a *compound* to be considered a *pure substance*, which is to say that 2 (or more elements) comprise a homogeneous mixture. We have given the name 'water' to the compound of $H_2O$, and for the substance to satisfy the definition and name of *water* it must:

- consist of only two elements: hydrogen and oxygen
- the two elements are bonded together in the ratio of $2\ H$ to $1\ O$

<br />

## Question 16

?> State and explain the law of multiple proportions. How is the law of multiple proportions different from the law of definite proportions?

> "When two elements (call them $A$ and $B$) form two different compounds, the masses of element $B$ that combine with $1\ g$ of element $A$ can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers."

The Law of Definite Proportions refers to the same compound and that samples of the compound prepared differently will always consist of the same ratio of elements. The Law of Multiple Proportions is comparing different compounds (that contain the same components) and states that the ratio of the elements in either compound always relate to each other in terms of a whole number.

<br />

## Question 17

?> What are the main ideas in Dalton's Atomic Theory? How do they help explain the laws of conservation of mass, of constant composition, and of definite proportions?

Page 45, Dalton's Atomic Theory:

 - Each element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms.
 - All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements. (Law of Constant Composition, of Definite Proportions)
 - Atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds. (Law of Constant Composition, of Definite Proportions)
 - Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. (Law of Constant Composition, of Definite Proportions) In a chemical reaction, atoms only change the way that they are bound together with other atoms. (Law of Conservation of Mass, )

## Question 19

?> Explain Millikan's oil drop experiment and how it led to the measurement of the electron's charge. Why is the magnitude of the charge of the electron so important?

Millikan sprayed oil droplets through a screen. As the droplets fell, they were ionized by EM radiation. Once ionized, Millikan was able to control the net force on the droplets through changes to the electric field inside the container. The value of charge was obtained through analyzing the mass of the droplets and the magnitude of the electric field. Understanding the properties of the electron is important because it is the key subatomic particle to most things: it allows atoms to bond together to form compounds, it lets us power technology, etc.

<br />

## Question 20

?> Describe the plum-pudding model of the atom.

The plum-pudding model of the atom supposes that the negatively charge electrons are trapped inside a positively charged sphere, such that each atom was overall electrically neutral.

<br />

## Question 21

?> Describe Rutherford's gold foil experiment. How did the experiment prove that the plum-pudding model of the atom was wrong?

Rutherford expected $\alpha$ particles to pass through the atoms, as they expected the mass and charge of the atom to be spread out throughout the sphere. A subset of the $\alpha$ particles sent at the gold foil took trajectories that could only be explained by a collision with a massive (massive compared to the $\alpha$ particle) volume. The plum-pudding model had nothing but electrons that the $\alpha$ particles could collide with, and they couldn't account for the trajectories without violating the Law of Conservation of Momentum.

<br />

## Question 22

?> Describe Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom. What was revolutionary about his model?

This lead Rutherford to theorize the presence of a nucleus in the atom, comprised of a particle called *protons* that have opposite charge of electrons but much more mass and are tightly packed together at the center of an atom. The majority of the volume of an atom was still theorized to be empty, save the electrons and nucleus.

<br />

## Question 29

?> Describe the two different notations used to specify isotopes and give an example of each.

Notation 1:

$$\,_{Z}^A X \equiv \begin{cases}
A &\rightarrow\text{ Mass number:} &\text{ number of protons + number of neutrons}\\
Z &\rightarrow\text{ Atomic number:} &\text{ number of protons in nucleus}\\
X &\rightarrow\text{ Chemical Symbol:} &\text{ the unique short hand for an element}
\end{cases}$$

Notation 2:

$$X\text{-}A$$

Example:

$$\,_{10}^{20} Ne,\qquad Ne\text{-}20$$

<br />

## Question 34

?> Why is the mass corresponding to a mole of one element different from the mass corresponding to a mole of another element?

A mole of one element is $6.022\times 10^{23}$ atoms of that element, so comparing the mass for one mole of one element to one mole of another element is, at its heart, comparing the mass of one element to another: they're different because they contain a different number of protons, neutrons, and electrons; you're just also seeing that difference scaled by a factor of $10^{23}$.

# 1.2: Classifying Matter

$$\ $$

## Question 35

?> Each shape represents a type of particle (such as an atom or a molecule). Classify each image as a pure substance, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture.

- Both image a and b are pure substances: they are comprised of a single element.
- Image c is a homogeneous mixture, if we assume the distribution is uniform throughout the substance.
- Image d is a heterogeneous mixture, as the distribution of red cylinders to blue boxes is not uniform throughout the sample.

<br />

## Question 42

?> Determine whether each molecular diagram represents a pure substance or a mixture. If it represents a pure substance, classify the substance as an element or a compound. If it represents a mixture, classify the mixture as homogeneous or heterogeneous.

- Image a is an element (pure substance)
- Image b is a homogeneous mixture
- Image c is a compound (pure substance)
- Image d is a compound (pure substance)

# 1.5: Atomic Theory

$$\ $$

## Question 57

?> Which statements are *consistent* with Dalton's atomic theory as it was originally stated? Why?
?>
?> - a. Sulfur and oxygen atoms has the same mass.
?> - b. All cobalt atoms are identical.
?> - c. Potassium and chlorine atoms combine in a $1:1$ ratio to form potassium chloride.
?> - d. Lead atoms can be converted into gold.

Statements *b* and *c* are consistent, as *b* refers to the 'atoms of an element having the same mass and other properties that distinguish it from other elements', and *c* refers to 'atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds'.

Statements *a* and *d* violate Statement *b* and that 'atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element'.

<br />

## Question 64

?> Which statements about subatomic particles are false?
?>
?> - a. Protons and electrons have charges of the same magnitude but opposite sign.
?> - b. Protons have about the same mass as neutrons.
?> - c. Some atoms don't have any protons.
?> - d. Protons and neutrons have charges of the same magnitude but opposite signs.

Statements *c* and *d* are false: Protons bind electrons to an *orbit* to create the simplest atom: hydrogen; Neutrons are neutrally charged (hence the name!).
