# Week 1 Day 2: Recitation, Problem Set 2

<br />

# Question 1

?> An isotope of an atom has an atomic number of 38 and mass number of 88. Find the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in this isotope.



<br />

<hr>

# Question 2

?> What does "X" represent in the following symbol? $$\,_{35}^{80}X$$

"X" is called the *chemical symbol*, it is the unique short hand for an element.

| Element | Chemical Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Mercury | $Hg$ |
| Chlorine | $Cl$ |
| Scandium | $Sc$ |
| Bromine | $Br$ |
| Selenium | $Se$ |

<br />

<hr>

# Question 3

?> Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the following: $$\,_{29}^{65}X$$

Recall that:

$$\,_{Z}^A X \equiv \begin{cases}
A &\rightarrow\text{ Mass number:} &\text{ number of protons + number of neutrons}\\
Z &\rightarrow\text{ Atomic number:} &\text{ number of protons in nucleus}\\
X &\rightarrow\text{ Chemical Symbol:} &\text{ the unique short hand for an element}
\end{cases}$$

Because we are not given the chemical symbol, we begin by identifing the element using the given atomic number ($Z$): $29$. Element $29$ on the Periodic table is $Cu$ (Copper) and has:

- $29$ protons
- $36$ neutrons
- $29$ electrons

<br />

<hr>

# Question 5

?> What species is represented by the following information? $$p^+=47 \qquad n^\circ=62 \qquad e^-=46$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 6

?> Calculate the atomic mass of element "X", if it has 2 naturally occurring isotopes with the following masses and natural abundances. $$\begin{aligned} \text{X-107} &\quad 106.90509\text{ amu} & 51.84\%\\ \text{X-109} &\quad 108.90476\text{ amu} & 48.46\% \end{aligned}$$

<br />

<hr>

# Question 7

?> Silver has an atomic mass of $107.868$ amu. The Ag-$109$ isotope ($108.905$ amu) is $48.161\%$. What is the amu of the other isotope?

<br />

<hr>

# Question 8

?> Calculate the atomic mass of magnesium, if magnesium has 3 naturally occurring stable isotopes with the following masses and natural abundances: $$\begin{aligned} \text{Mg-24} &\quad 23.9996\text{ amu} & 78.99\%\\ \text{Mg-25} &\quad 24.9858\text{ amu} & 10.00\%\\
\text{Mg-26} &\quad 25.9826\text{ amu} & 11.01\% \end{aligned}$$
