# Question 1: Unit Conversion

Convert the following quantities.

## Part A

?> $581 K$ to $\newcommand\degC{\,^{\circ}C}\degC$

$$\newcommand\degC{\,^{\circ}C}\begin{aligned}
\degC &\equiv K - 273.15\\
&= 581 K - 273.15 K\\
&= 307.85^{\circ}C \\
&\Rightarrow 3.08 \times 10^2  \degC
\end{aligned}$$

<br />

## Part B

?> $235\ lbs$ to $g$

$$\begin{aligned}
1g &\equiv 0.002205\ lbs\\
&= \frac{235\ lbs}{1}\frac{1g}{0.002205\ lbs}\\
&= 106594 g \\
&\Rightarrow 1.07 \times 10^5 g
\end{aligned}$$

<br />

## Part C

?> $75 ms$ to $ns$

$$\begin{aligned}
1 ms &\equiv 1\times 10^3 ns\\
&= 7.5 \times 10^4 ns\\
\end{aligned}$$

<br />

## Part D

?> $54 m^2$ to $cm^2$

$$\begin{aligned}
(1 m)^2 &\equiv (100 cm)^2\\
&= \frac{54 m^2}{1}\frac{(10^2 cm)^2}{1 m^2}\\
&= 5.4 \times 10^5 cm^2
\end{aligned}$$

<br />

## Part E

?> $1250 cm^3$ to $L$

$$\begin{aligned}
1 L &\equiv 1000 cm^3\\
&= \frac{1250 cm^3}{1}\frac{1 L}{1000 cm^3}\\
&= 1.25 L
\end{aligned}$$

# Question 2: Accuracy and Precision

?> A student performs an experiment to determine the density of a sugar solution. They obtain the following results: $1.71\ g/mL$, $1.72 \ g/mL$, $1.69\ g/mL$, and $1.70\ g/mL$. The actual value for the density of the sugar solution is $1.80\ g/mL$. Are their experimental results accurate? Are their experimental results precise?

Accuracy refers to how close the result is to the actual value, while precise refers to how tightly a series of measurements are grouped (reproducibility). Taking a quick average of the students measurements, we obtain a mean value of $1.71\ g/mL$; from this, we can see that the students measurements are precise. All of the student's measurements are below the expected actual value, so, we can say that they are inaccurate.

$5$ significant figures: the two digits before the decimal and the three following.

<br />

## Part B

?> $0.03020\ kg$

$4$ significant figures: $3.020$

<br />


## Part C

?> $3200\ lbs$

$2$ significant figures: $3.2$

<br />

## Part D

?> $3.2\times 10^3\ lbs$

$2$ significant figures: $3.2$

<br />

## Part E

?> $3.200 \times 10^3\ lbs$

$4$ significant figures: $3.200$

# Question 4: Significant Figures in Calculations

What answer should be reported, with the correct number of significant figures, for the following calculation?

## Part A

?> $7821.3+1.258$

$4$ significant figures: $7823$

<br />

## Part B

?> $256.975-25.2$

$3$ significant figures: $232$

<br />

## Part C

?> $6.347\times 7.25871$

$4$ significant figures: $46.07$

<br />

## Part D

?> $25.00/5.0$

$2$ significant figures: $5.0$

<br />

## Part E

?> $(438.751-233.8)\times 11.700$

$4$ significant figures: $2398$

<br />

## Part F

?> $5420.10/(25.578+247.4)$

$4$ significant figures: $19.86$

# Question 5: Volume from Density

?> Determine the volume of an object that has a mass of $455.6\ g$ and a density of $19.3\ g/cm^3$.

$$\begin{aligned}
V &= \frac{m}{d}\\
&= \frac{455.6\ g}{1}\frac{1\ cm^3}{19.3\ g}\\
&= 23.6\ cm^3
\end{aligned}$$
