3.
Have taken:
  Sophomore/Junior Level:
    - PH 21X, Physics with Calculus
    - PH 315: Contemporary Challenges in Physics
    - PH 335: Theoretical Mechanics
    - PH 411: Electronics
    - PH 42X: Paradigm Sequence (Static Fields, Quantum Fundamentals, Central Forces, Oscillations and Waves, Periodic Systems, Energy and Entropy)
    - PH 36X: Computational Lab

    - MTH 25X, Differential Calculus through Differential Equations
    - MTH 341/2: Linear Algebra (1 and 2)

  Senior/Grad Level:
- PH 481: Physical Optics
- PH 431: Capstone, E&M
- PH 451: Capstone, QM
- PH 541: Capstone, Statistical Mechanics
- PH 562: Mathematical Physics
- PH 585: Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics

- MTH 434: Differential Geometry
- MTH 537: General Relativity

Currently Taking:
- PH 531: Capstone, E&M
- PH 651: QM
- PH 403: Thesis

4. Current plan is to head to graduate school to dive deeper into either: Cosmology & Relativity, Computational Astrophysics, or Quantum/Statistical Mechanics.

5. I started my fascination with Physics with Black Holes and General Relativity, but over the past year I have found QM and Thermodynamics very interesting.

6. I hope to leave this course with a stronger understanding of E&M than the last time. Previously, I felt like I could understand the gist of what Griffiths was trying to get at but felt the lack of overarching connection of each concept beyond "E&M".

7. Yes, I'm looking at some fun stuff with respect to Black Holes with Dr. Kathryn Hadley.

8. I do have Mathematica already installed on my computer. I do know about 304f but will most likely avoid it this term due to current circumstances.
