# Problem 2.7

> Find the electric field at a distance $z$ from the center of a spherical surface of radius $R$ that carries a uniform charge density $\sigma$. Treat both the case of inside and outside the shell and express your answer in terms of the total charge $q$ on the sphere.

Since no thickness is specified, we will assume that the spherical surface can be considered as a shell with infinitesimal thickness or similarly treated as a $S^2$ (2-sphere). Since the *surface* charge density is given as being uniform across $S^2$
