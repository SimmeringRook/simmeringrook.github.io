## Previously

Shortly before the scheduled meeting on 11/05, an attempt was made to implement a plot describing the scattering of a non-radial plunge trajectory. Equation 9.49 from page 201 of Hartle describes the change as:

$$\frac{d\phi}{dr} = \pm \frac{\ell^2}{r^2} \left\[e^2 - \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\left(1+\frac{\ell^2}{r^2}\right)\right\]^{-1/2}$$

And crudely implemented as:

``` python
def shape_of_bound_orbit(rcoordinate, orbitalAngularMomentum, totalenergy_per_unitrestmass):
    return (orbitalAngularMomentum / np.power(rcoordinate, 2))
     * 1 / np.power(( np.power(totalenergy_per_unitrestmass, 2) - (1 - (2*M)/rcoordinate) 
     * (1 + np.power( (orbitalAngularMomentum / rcoordinate), 2) ) ), 0.5)
```

It was this function, during the meeting, that brought up the very subtle but important question as to *from which frame is this change being measured?*

## Advice

Oksana said for Computational Physics to make everything dimensionless.

### Dynamic orders for intervals

``` python
def proper_distance_vs_geometric(proper_distance):
    for r in __r_domain :
        #print( (r - __r_domain[0]) * __r_iteration_direction )
        '''Since the starting value of __r_domain isn't necessarilly 0, we need to subtract the difference to access
        the first index in the array.
        E.g., 
            We want the r-coordinate domain of our calculations to be within [2M, 40M] with a resolution of 0.1.
            __r_domain will have the values in an array of size (stop - start)/resolution;
            So, during the first iteration of this loop, `r` will have the value of (2M / 0.1) = 20M.
            We want to use `r` to also index the proper_distance array, as they are of the same length, so:
            (r - __r_domain[0]) = 0
        
        Next problem: we've set the step direction for the domains to dynamically respond to different orders.
        E.g.,
            (r - __r_domain[0]) = 0 still works for the first iteration of the loop,
            but since r = __r_domain[1], where __r_domain[1] is now less than __r_domain[0],
            this will throw an error as "-1" is not a valid index.
            We can resolve this by multiplying by the __r_iteration_direction to correct to a positive index
            and the loop will iterrate correctly iregardless if our intervals look like: [2M, 40M] or [40M, 2M]
        '''
        proper_distance[ (r - __r_domain[0]) * __r_iteration_direction ] = np.sqrt(1 - (2*M)/(r*__r_step_resolution))
```
