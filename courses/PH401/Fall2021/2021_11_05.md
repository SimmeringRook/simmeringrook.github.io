## Framework Scafolding

### Python

I learned a few interesting things about how Python deals with inheritance and classes.

- Class variables
    - 'Global' in scope, C# comparision is a 'static' class variable (shared acrossed all instances)
- Polymorphism
    - either doesn't exist
    - or you just assume the thing you've been passed has the attributes you want to call
        - makes it harder to treat an abstract object
    - overriding methods is weird
        - sometimes still class the base class when executing
        - isn't horrible but requires a mental model reframing

### Latticework.py

Part of the focus here was to remove the dynamic initialization and population of the `nodes` array: E.g., this horrible abomination that was bound to break and cause issues in the future:

``` python
    def __populate_Lattice(self):
        # numpy.shape() returns a tuple describe the dimensions of the numpy array
        # We can asked for the 
        numberOfDimensions = len(numpy.shape(self._nodes))
        print("Number of Dimensions:", numberOfDimensions)

        for dimension in range(numberOfDimensions):
            print("Length of Dimension:", numpy.shape(self._nodes)[dimension])

        for x in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[numberOfDimensions - numberOfDimensions]):
            for y in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[numberOfDimensions 
                - numberOfDimensions + 1]):
                if (numberOfDimensions - numberOfDimensions + 2) < numberOfDimensions:
                    for z in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[numberOfDimensions - 
                        numberOfDimensions + 2]):
                        if (numberOfDimensions - numberOfDimensions + 3) < 
                            numberOfDimensions:
                            for t in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[numberOfDimensions 
                                - numberOfDimensions + 3]):
                                self._nodes[x,y,z,t] = Node(tuple((x,y,z,t)))
                        else:
                            self._nodes[x,y,z] = Node(tuple((x,y,z)))
                else:
                    self._nodes[x,y] = Node(tuple((x,y)))
```

The concept was to implement some pre-optimization in which the N-dimensional `nodes` array only created the correct number of dimensions as required by the given `SpacetimeGeometry` being used as the basis. For example, if Cartographer was told to create a 1+1 representation of Schwarzschild spacetime, `nodes` only needs to be a 2-dimensional array: 1 spatial and 1 temporal. The above function could be cleaned up, to remove all the redundant `numberOfDimensions - numberOfDimensions` calculations [^1]:

[^1]: Ironically, the design decision behind this was to avoid hardcoding the indicies for the different dimensions in each loop, but ultimately failed as the `Node` class wants to know its index position in the N-dimensional array. This design decision came about from previous hobby experience in game design where it becomes very useful for each tile in a board to be able to inform you of its coordinates: E.g, very helpful when needing to access neighbors.

``` python
    def __populate_Lattice(self):
        # ...
        for x in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[0]):
            for y in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[1]):
                if 2 < numberOfDimensions:
                    for z in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[2]):
                        if 3 < numberOfDimensions:
                            for t in range(numpy.shape(self._nodes)[3]):
                                self._nodes[x,y,z,t] = Node(tuple((x,y,z,t)))
                        else:
                            self._nodes[x,y,z] = Node(tuple((x,y,z)))
                else:
                    self._nodes[x,y] = Node(tuple((x,y)))
```

But that doesn't solve the underlying problem that this implementation:

- is hard to read and interpret
- makes assumptions about the geometry

While the loop variables have no 'direct' influence on what information is stored in `nodes`, they are revealing an implicit intended structure which is intentionally supposed to be absent. Ultimately, this was supposed to be resovled by having the onus be placed on Cartographer. If the user is asking for a specific latticework structure, they would be able to tell Cartographer how big each dimension needs to be and how many via the `gridShape` parameter in the class constructor:

```python
    def __init__(self, gridShape = tuple((4,4)), spacetime = EuclideanGeometry(2)):
        self._spacetime = spacetime
        self._nodes = numpy.empty(gridShape, dtype=object)
```
The details of initializing each `Node` in `nodes` was delayed until later, with a focus to getting a simple deliverable ready by Friday. Cartographer is supposed to generate plots of objects in spacetime and so figuring out how to generate those figures became more of a priority than the architecture of the framework.

### Cartographer.py

After resolving the weirdness of inheritance (and lack of polymorphism?) in Python, work focused on getting correct 'measurements' in Spacetime. Euclidean geometry uses the Pythagorean theorem to measure distances, so creating two points in separate orthogonal directions would be a simple test of the implementation. Similarly, the implementation of the metric for Minkowski spacetime should require only minor tweaking and both cases will serve as simple tests to verify the implementation works regardless of the geometry. In `Cartographer.py`, the following was added for this purpose:

```python
def main():
    gridsize = tuple((4,4,4,1))
    lattice = Latticework(gridsize)

    dx = tuple((2,0,0,0))
    dy = tuple((0,2,0,0))
    dt = tuple((0,0,0,4))

    euclideanPath = mark_out_path(dx,dy)
    minkowskiPath = mark_out_path(dx,dt)

    print("Euclidean:", euclideanPath, lattice._spacetime.Act_Metric_On(
        euclideanPath,euclideanPath))
    lattice._spacetime = SchwarzschildGeometry()
    print("Schwarzschild:", minkowskiPath, lattice._spacetime.Act_Metric_On(
        minkowskiPath,minkowskiPath))

def mark_out_path(start, stop):
    return tuple(map(lambda i, j: i - j, start, stop))
```

`mark_out_path` is just a minor helper function to create the (directed) line segement that connect the second point to the first. `lattice` was initialized with default parameters and so the type of `SpacetimeGeometry` assinged to `lattice._spacetime` was a 2-dimensional `EuclideanGeometry`. This child class really only serves to assign the correct metric signature to be used in calculations. The result given by `lattice._spacetime.Act_Metric_On` is then equivalent to asking for the squared magnitude of the vector. Taking the square root was omitted at this step as that's something to occur after the metric is used.

```
/GitHub/Cartographer/Cartographer.py
Creating Geometry with the metric: (1, 1)
Euclidean: (2, -2, 0, 0) 8
Creating Geometry with the metric: (1, 1, 1, -1)
Schwarzschild: (2, 0, 0, -4) -12
```

#### EuclideanGeometry.py

```python
from SpacetimeGeometry import SpacetimeGeometry

class EuclideanGeometry(SpacetimeGeometry):

    __Metric = tuple(( tuple((1,)), tuple((1,1)), tuple((1,1,1)) ))

    def __init__(self, dimesionality=2):
        super().__init__(EuclideanGeometry.__Metric[
            len(EuclideanGeometry.__Metric) - dimesionality])
```

#### SpacetimeGeometry.py

Since the default metric in `SpacetimeGeometry` (at this time) is 3+1 Minkowski, a `MinkowskiGeometry` has not been implemented yet.

```python
class SpacetimeGeometry:
    
    #__Metric = tuple((1,1,1,-1))

    def __init__(self, metric=tuple((1,1,1,-1))):
        print("Creating Geometry with the metric:", metric)
        self.__metric = metric

    def get_Dimensionality(self):
        return len(self.__metric)

    def Act_Metric_On(self, pForm1, pForm2):
        metricResult = 0
        for i in range(len(self.__metric)):
            metricResult += pForm1[i] * self.__metric[i] * pForm2[i]
        return metricResult
```

### Final Woes of Architecture

The natural next step was to move on to implementing `SchwarzschildGeometry` and that's where this approach came to a halt. Mathematically, it's a trivial matter to tell you how the metric acts on 1-forms for Schwarzschild:

$$\begin{aligned}
g(dr,dr) &= \frac{1}{1-\frac{2M}{r}} \\
g(r\sin{\theta}d\phi, r\sin{\theta}d\phi) &= 1 \\
g(rd\theta, rd\theta) &= 1 \\
g(dt,dt) = -(1-\frac{2M}{r})
\end{aligned}$$

And in other Computer-Aided Algebra systems like Mathematica, the parameterization is equally as trivial: we just declare the dependence on the parameter called `r`. Python won't immediately freak out if we try to do this:

```python
#...
    self.__metric = tuple( (1/math.sqrt(1-2*M/r), 1, 1, math.sqrt(1-2*M/r)) )
```

We can always specify the mass of the black hole (in meters), `M`, globally or handle the scope differently. The problem is "what is `r`?" and "how do we tell the script later on that `r` now has a new value?". There are workarounds to avoid hardcoding the value, but this was just deeper and deeper into the weeds of architecture and no where closer to even getting a simple plot of Minkowski (or even Euclidean!) space.

## Design Shift: Figures first, Grand Architecture later

With even more focused being place on the generation of figures, the question shifted to "how?". At this point, it is out of scope to build a plotting/graphic framework from scratch and I intended for Cartographer to be able to both export data (save on calculations in the future) and generate the figures, with the inkling of utilizing Matplotlib to format everything. So, keeping things as simple as possible and mentally reframing the project as a simple PH36X: Computational Lab assignment, the ungloriously named `plot.py` file was created. In defiance of experience, caution about future interoperability and extension was thrown to the wind to focus on direct implementation of equations of motion in Schwarzschild.

### Arrays

Matplotlib prefers to have an array for both the horizontal and vertical axes[^2] 

[^2]: This makes a lot more sense in hindsight, considering how Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets require the columns for both as well.
