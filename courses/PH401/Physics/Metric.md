# Metric

The Metric is the mathematical object that informs us how to measure distance in a given space.

## Euclidean

This is the most common way people are aware of how to calculate the distance between two points: the square root of the sum of the squares or more succinctly: the Pythagorean Theorem.

$$distance = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

The underlying geometry of these spaces is sometimes called "triangle geometry". (MTH 537, Professor Dray)

## Minkowski

The simplest Non-Euclidean geometry to deal with. Since time has been introduced, distance is measured hyperbolically.

$$distance = \sqrt{x^2 - (ct)^2}$$

## Schwarzschild
