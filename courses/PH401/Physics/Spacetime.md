# Spacetime

"Spacetime" is just a shorthand for denoting the addition of time to the dimensions considered when talking about distances. Inherently, we must measure distance differently in the context of spacetime than we would in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions of space. Distance in this more common sense is typically done through the Pythagorean Theorem (also known as a Euclidean distance measurement), whereas, distance in spacetime is measured using Non-Euclidean geometry.

The mathematical object that informs us how to measure distance in our new geometric framework is called the [Metric](/courses/PH401/Physics/Metric.md).
