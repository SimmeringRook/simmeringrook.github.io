## Week 1

### Day 1
First 2-3 Weeks:
 - Review Thermal Physics (Macroscopic)

Week 4-10:
 - Statistical Physics
 - Microscopic thermodynamics

#### Macroscopic Thermodynamics
There are four laws of Thermodynamics: (page 122-123)
1. Thermal Equilibrium
2. $dE = -đW + đQ$
3. Principle of the Increase of Entropy
4. Minimal Entropy

##### The Zeroth Law
?> if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

##### The First Law

- Conservation of Energy
- $E$ is the internal energy of the system
  - $dE$ is a change of the internal energy ([exact](/maths/Differentials.md) & total differential)
  - a function of the state of the system
    - E.g., for a gas in a bottle, the state of the system is described by number of molecules, volume, and temperature.
- $W$ is work
  - $\bar{d}W$ is an [inexact](/maths/Differentials.md) differential
  - The work you have to do is not determined by the state of the system; but by the process.
  - Not a state function
- $Q$ is heat transfer
  - $\text{đ}Q$ is the heat absorbed by the system.

Reversible
- The first law becomes: $dE=đQ-pdV$
  - an Isolated system receives no heat energy, so $dE=-pdV$
  - Otherwise, the system absorbs heat through a quasistatic process:
    - $đQ=TdS$


##### The Second Law

Describes the direction of natural processes.
  - E.g., heat cannot (naturally) transfer from a colder body to a hotter body

We can quantify the macroscopic state of a system using [Entropy](/physics/Entropy.md).
For an isolated system:
$$\Delta S_{system} \geq 0$$

If the system is not isolated and undergoes a quasistatic infinitesimal process in which it absorbs heat $dQ$, then:
$$dS=\frac{đQ}{T} \Leftrightarrow TdS=đQ$$



### Day 2

Review of last class's concepts:
- $đQ=dE+đW$
  - We can decompose the heat into kinetic and potential energy.
- Definition of change of entropy:
  - if the system is isolated and undergoes an infinitesimal quasistatic process
    - $dS=\frac{đQ}{T}$
  - if the system is isolated and we go from one macroscopic state to another:
    - $\Delta S \geq 0$
    - **Thermally Isolated**, $\Delta S$ cannot be less than $0$
  - called the: Principle of the Increase of Entropy
  - Clausius's Statement:
    - "Heat cannot, by itself, pass from a colder to a hotter body"
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta S &= \frac{-đQ}{T_A}+\frac{đQ}{T_B} \\
&= đQ\left(\frac{1}{T_B}-\frac{1}{T_A}\right) < 0
\end{aligned}$$
  - Kelvin's Statement:
    - "A process whose **only** effect is the **complete** conversion of Heat (energy) into Work cannot occur."
      - $đQ\rightarrow đW$
      - $dS = \frac{-đQ}{T} < 0$
    - This is why engines cannot have $100$ % efficiency

!> Statements in Thermodynamics must be precise. Lacking keywords can invalidate the entire statement.

##### The Third Law

The limiting property of entropy:

?> As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.  $T\rightarrow 0_+,\qquad S\rightarrow S_0 = 0$

We'll discuss this later in the course.

#### Review of Math in Thermodynamics

##### Rules of total derivatives

Consider two single variable functions: $f(x),\ g(x)$

###### Linearity
$$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x))=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)+\frac{d}{dx}g(x)$$

###### Product rule
$$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)\cdot g(x))=f(x)\frac{d}{dx}g(x)+g(x)\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)=\left(f(x)\frac{d}{dx}g(x)-g(x)\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\right)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{g(x)^2}\right)$$

###### Chain rule
$$f(U(x))$$
$$\frac{df}{dx}=\frac{df}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}$$

##### Rules for Partial derivatives

Let $E$ be the energy of the system.
$$E=E(T,V) = E(p, V) = E(p, T)$$

Any two thermodynamic variables are independent. However, if you look at three parameters together, you cannot change them independently of each other.

Consider the multivariable function $f(x,y)$:

$$\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y$$
- Describes the change of $f$ as the result of the change of $x$ while keeping $y$ fixed/constant

!> Always write the specific parameters that are held constant.

###### Clauriet's Theorem
$$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)_x \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x} = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)_y \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x$$

We use this to derive [Maxwell's Relations].

###### Reciprocal Rule

$f(x,y)=0$

$$df=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y dx + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x dy$$
Consider $df=0$ because $f(x,y)=0$:
$$0=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y dx + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x dy$$
$$\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y dx = - \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x dy$$
$$\left(\frac{dx}{dy}\right) = - \frac{ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y}$$

We can rewrite: $f(x,y)=0$ as $x(f,y)$ or $y(f,x)$ which means the left-hand side should really be partial derivatives

$$\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_f = - \frac{ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y}$$

Repeat the same process and we obtain the following:

$$\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_f = - \frac{ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_y}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_x}$$

Which shows us that they're inversely related to each other:

$$\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_f = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_f}$$

###### Cyclic Rule:

$f(x,y,z)=0$

$$\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x = -1$$

Proving this rule is the same as the Reciprocal Rule.
- $df(x,y,z)=0$
  - $df = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y,z} dx + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x,z} dy + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y} dz$
- treat $z$ constant
  - $df = 0 = dz$
  - $\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z = - \frac{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x,z}}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y,z}}$
- treat $x$ constant
  - $df = 0 = dx$
  - $\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x = - \frac{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y}}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x,z}}$
- treat $y$ constant
  - $df = 0 = dy$
  - $\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y = - \frac{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y,z}}{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y}}$

$$\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_z \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)_y \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x = -1$$

### Day 3

We're going to use the math tools from the previous class to look at:
- Van der Waals gas
- Volumetric compressibility
