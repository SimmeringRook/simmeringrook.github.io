#### Macroscopic Thermodynamics
There are four laws of Thermodynamics: (page 122-123)
1. Thermal Equilibrium
2. $dE = -đW + đQ$
3. $\Delta S_{system} \geq 0$
4. Minimal Entropy

##### The Zeroth Law
?> if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

##### The First Law

- Conservation of Energy
- $E$ is the internal energy of the system
  - $dE$ is a change of the internal energy ([exact](/maths/Differentials.md) & total differential)
  - a function of the state of the system
    - E.g., for a gas in a bottle, the state of the system is described by number of molecules, volume, and temperature.
- $W$ is work
  - $\bar{d}W$ is an [inexact](/maths/Differentials.md) differential
  - The work you have to do is not determined by the state of the system; but by the process.
  - Not a state function
- $Q$ is heat transfer
  - $\text{đ}Q$ is the heat absorbed by the system.

Reversible
- The first law becomes: $dE=đQ-pdV$
  - an Isolated system receives no heat energy, so $dE=-pdV$
  - Otherwise, the system absorbs heat through a quasistatic process:
    - $đQ=TdS$


##### The Second Law

Describes the direction of natural processes.
  - E.g., heat cannot (naturally) transfer from a colder body to a hotter body

We can quantify the macroscopic state of a system using [Entropy](/physics/Entropy.md).
For an isolated system:
$$\Delta S_{system} \geq 0$$

If the system is not isolated and undergoes a quasistatic infinitesimal process in which it absorbs heat $dQ$, then:
$$dS=\frac{đQ}{T} \Leftrightarrow TdS=đQ$$

##### The Third Law

?> As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.
