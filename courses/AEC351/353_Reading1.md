## Prompt

> $$\ $$ In your own original writing, explain why containerization was an important form of technological change for international shipping in the 20th century.

$$\ $$

## Response

> $$\ $$

Containers allowed for massive bulk movement of goods at the biggest bottleneck: the sea-land interface[^1]. Much in the way that coal power fueled the industrial revolution by giving access to consistent, on demand, and more powerful mechanical work, containers allowed for faster loading/unloading of goods at the port. Paul Krugman summarizes this in his special lecture:

> "What was the big bottleneck was getting things on and off the ships. A large part of the costs of international trade was taking the cargo off the ship, sorting it out, and dealing with the pilferage that always took place along the way. [...] it was the container, which could be hauled off a ship and put onto a truck or a train and moved on." 

As a personal anecdote, the use of shipping containers made the logistics of moving gear for the military a breeze. My engineering company consisted of three platoons, all with slightly diffferent tasks and destinations; each group was given one shipping container to load with their necessary equipment. Contrasting this with each individual's gear (at least 3 bags), the containers were exceedingly efficient. At each point transfer point for personel, all $3$ bags for the $80+$ personel had to be unloaded, sorted, and re-loaded. 

If we construct a simple model for estimating the possible error in logistics and give that any one item has a $5\%$ chance of heading to the incorrect destination, we can qualitatively see the benefits:

$$0.1\%\text{ per item} \begin{pmatrix} 3\text{ containers} \\ 240\text{ bags} \end{pmatrix} \approx \begin{pmatrix}0.3\% \\ 24\%\end{pmatrix}\text{ of a shipping error}$$
