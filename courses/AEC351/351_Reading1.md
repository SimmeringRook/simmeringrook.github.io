## Prompt

> $$\ $$ Using complete sentences, in your own words explain how Baumeister and Kilian (2016) define an oil price shock.

$$\ $$

## Response

> $$\ $$

I would claim that Baumeister and Kilian provide the most succint definition of an oil price shock on page 141[^-1]: "[the] gap between the price of oil that [is] expected and its [actual] outcome." While the actualized price of oil is empirical, expectations are normative. Baumeister and Kilian demonstrate this by detailing how four major agents predict flucuations to the price. These four major categories of economic agents are: Economists, Policymakers, the Financial Market, and Consumers (firms and households).

While each of these agents have varying levels of sophistication in their modeling of future oil prices and predict--sometimes drastically--different trends, they all experience *shocks*. The impact for each category is directly tied to the magnitude of disagreement between their predictions and reality.
