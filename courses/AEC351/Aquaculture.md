Technology and production methods for extracting resources from aquaculture have managed to supply the rapid growth of seafood availability to the global food market (\Anderson) and are forecasted to increase the supply of fish consumption to 2/3rds by 2030. \Lam specifically notes that the supply from aquaculture is forecast to overshadow capture fishery production by this same 2030 timeframe. While the industry has demonstrated the capacity to fulfill demand, it is unclear if aquaculture provides a means of sustainable resource harvest. Under the lens of applied economics, we will use the definition of sustainable from page 73 of the \Field text:

> "... the notion of sustainability to the case of a renewable resource. In this case sustainability means the continued availability of a renewable resource to present and future generations."

## What is Aquaculture?

Aquaculture is broadly defined as the cultivation of aquatic organisms under controlled conditions (\Lam). In the encyclopedia article by \CostaP, a recurring theme is the lack of specificity for many terms. While their definition of *sustainable* aligns with the interpretation from \Field, \CostaP note that even the term of *aquaculture* is unclear. A major focus of this topic is skewed towards marine animal husbandry and not the other aspects such as environmental enhancement and rehabilitation. Fortunately, the typical model of aquaculture, \gls{imta}, works to cultivate fed and extractive species simultaneously (\Chopin). This method is referred to as polyculture and serves to enhance total production through efficient use of space.

The most promising concept of this efficient *land-use* beyond diversification seafood product is the incorporation of renewable energy sources. The common proposition is to adjust the structural base of offshore wind farms to also serve as anchor points for various aquaculture structures (\Buck). These can range from rings that facilitate growth of macroalgae to fish cages.

## Sustainability and Current Research

What \Lam, \CostaP, and \Anderson all unanimously agree upon is that the science aspect of aquaculture is still a young and relatively unexplored topic for research. All of these papers approach the call for further research from different angles: \Lam in the context of ethical harvesting, \CostaP and \Buck in the context of further developments to \gls{imta} and aquaculture processes in general, and \Anderson specifically noting the lack of incorporation of natural resource economists.

While multiple papers do comment on the supply half of the equation growing consistently: 3.2% annual growth versus 1.6% average annual world population growth (\Lam), it is hard to state whether aquaculture is sustainable. At best, \Anderson notes that further research needs to be conducted to establish concerns around pollution, feeding, disease management, and food safety. \Lam offers a more conservative note that the UN Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries finds that the vast majority of wild capture fisheries are in non-compliance with sustainable practices. Ultimately, polyculture systems that support a diversity of product and simulate ecosystems like the \gls{imta} model offer a possible path forward for aquaculture to be sustainable in both an ecological and economical sense, but need further research and support from governments to properly study (\Buck).
