Technology and production methods for extracting resources from aquaculture have managed to supply the rapid growth of seafood availability to the global food market (\Anderson) and are forecasted to increase the supply of fish consumption to 2/3rds by 2030. While the industry has demonstrated the capacity to fulfill demand, it is unclear if aquaculture provides a means of sustainable resource harvest. Under the lens of applied economics, we will use the definition of sustainable from page 73 of the \Field text:

> "... the notion of sustainability to the case of a renewable resource. In this case sustainability means the continued availability of a renewable resource to present and future generations."

## What is Aquaculture?

Aquaculture is broadly defined as the cultivation of aquatic organisms under controlled conditions (\Lam).

> Anderson et al. discuss the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and its rising dominance for supplying the global food market. The US is now a major importer of sea food due to explicit bans on aquaculture in various coastal states and subsquently does not fund much economic research into this area. The authors advocate strongly for more inclusion of natural resource economists in the discussions of policy to better inform viability and sustainability of aquaculture for the fishery/aquaculture sectors. There are pollution, ethical, and safety concerns about current techniques and mangement of aquacultures but very limited research has examined these areas.

> The author for the encylopedia entry briefly discusses the history of aquaculture and showcases two promising current models: IMTA and SEA. These models are designed to be ecologically sustainable first and offer economic benefits as a result: diversification of product (and risk), efficient *land* use, and ethical benefits. Costa-Pierce reviews the adoption and spread of current aquaculture technology along coastal waters along with their costs and benefits.
