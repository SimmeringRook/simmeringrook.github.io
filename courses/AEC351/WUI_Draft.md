As the global climate undergoes changes, we can expect that the frequency of large and costly wildfires will continue to increase and affect societies, especially those located at the \gls{wui}. This essay will review potential strategies for how \gls{wui} communities might adapt to the rise of dangerous wildfires through an economic lens.

## What Is the WUI?

\Johnston provides an encyclopedia definition which seems to agree with what is the most common and cited definition: "the area where houses and other structures are built within or close to wildland vegetation." \Mell talks mentions that the government has three subcategories for this: interface, intermix, and occluded. But even then, the Federal Register allows for alternative definitions based on the context of housing or population density (\Mell). \Mell argues that to properly unify discussions and research around the specific cases, a standard definition needs to be established and I concur. \Schoennagel mostly sidesteps this by clarifying they are use the interface subcategory but do not clarify with respect to population or housing density.

Using this definition, \Schoennagel is able to provide a quantitative description of how \gls{wui} area has increased by 24% from 1990 to 2010. \Manzello estimates that 46 million structures and at least 120 million people reside in \gls{wui} areas. Wildfires have been a recognized as a serious problem since 1970s and the severity and frequency has only increased. \Mell notes that as of the time of writing in 2010, the top 10 fire-loss incidents all occurred at the \gls{wui} and within the last 20 years. \Schoennagel specifies that since 1990, the average annual number of structures lost to wildfire has increased by 300% and \Manzello prices the average property value dollar loss of $1.4 billon.

While \Schoennagel and \Mell avoid direct discussion of the global impact of increased wildfires on the \gls{wui} area, \Manzello highlights the needs for solutions applicable to the global community. The effects of wildfires in the \gls{wui} extend beyond property damage and loss of life to significant economic impacts, as was evident from the 2016 Fort McMurray, Canada fire which disrupted a quarter of Canada's oil production for a total estimated cost of $9 billon (\Manzello).

Where \Mell and \Schoennagel partially diverge is with respect to the cause of wildfires. Fundamentally, both agree that build-up of fuel contributes to the likelihood of a wildfire, however, \Schoennagel found that only half of the total forest burning came from dry forests. In principle, \Schoennagel does seem to agree with \Mell that the prolonged drought has been a significant factor, but goes further to source climate change (earlier snow melt and longer fire seasons) as the culprit.

## Current Methodology

Both \Mell and \Schoennagel discuss the current method for fire suppression is to treat the fuel. Johnston clarifies this as another vague definition as any method which alters the fuel to reduce fire severity or behaviour. The most common form of this is through proactive controlled burns, but this does not guarantee effective treatment.

On one hand, \Mell discusses that the amount of treated area annually is insignificant compared to what is declared as at-risk \gls{wui}: only ~1%. \Mell also notes that fuel is estimated to be accumulating three times faster than can be treated. Funding for this fuel treatment by the US Forest Service has increased from $1.3 billion during 1996 to 2000 to $3.1 billion during 2001 to 2005 (\Mell) and most recently up to $5 billion in 2006 to 2015 (\Schoennagel).

\Schoennagel elaborates on this by counting for the effects of ecosystem change, in that homogeneous forests are more prone to conversion to non-forest lands and that the lack of heterogeneity threatens to increase severity. \Schoennagel points out that most of the western US forest wildfires since 1984 have consisted primarily of sub-alpine cold/west forests, which have not had a significant build up of fuel.

\Manzello supplements the discussion by noting the global fire safety science community has a strong body of knowledge with respect to urban fire dynamics, but there are no validated models that describe wildfire spread or structure ignition for \gls{wui}.

## Findings

The conclusions of \Schoennagel with respect to the current paradigm appear to be reasonable. While over 50% of wildfires in the western US can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (\Schoennagel), the current strategy of suppression and control only seems to further this cycle. Large amounts of forest area lack fuel treatment through controlled burning, but an increased effort to burn away more fuel threatens to further entrench climate change consequences. This is further complicated as each burn must be carefully scheduled to reduce the impact on nearby communities that could be affected by reduced air quality from the smoke. Similarly, the effectiveness of ramping up these treatments seems to be slightly misplaced as high priority regions are considered those affected by drought and warming, which seems counterfactual to the wet and cold forests burning in the northern US.

In contrast to \Schoennagel, \Rasker propose the idea of mitigating costs by implementing a fire insurance policy similar to the national flood insurance. This policy is a further example of the current reactive paradigm that \Schoennagel argues against, as insurance only mitigates the damage cost to homeowners. While helping with property damage for communities inside the \gls{wui} should not be ignored, steps such as education about limiting vegetation density near structures decreases the chance of wildfire spread and actively helps prevent the property damage.

## Conclusion

Whilst \Schoennagel does not prescribe a specific solution, I find that their recommendation to adopting a more proactive paradigm for dealing with the \gls{wui} to have great merit. As was already discussed, the \gls{wui} is not a uniform environment and can vary drastically in how wild vegetation interacts with human structures. Both \Mell and \Schoennagel advocate for education of residents in \gls{wui} and for refined building codes to reduce the transfer from vegetation to structures through adequate physical spacing and structural material composition. All of this is also compatible with the suggestions from \Manzello and in-line with areas in need of further research. Ultimately, I agree with the sentiment of \Schoennagel that wildfires affecting the \gls{wui} are inevitable, and the best path forward for all global \gls{wui}s is to find methods that are adaptable to local conditions and actively mitigate further damage to the corresponding communities and ecosystems.
