# Introduction

> **Prompt** Have scientific and technological advances since the 1970s made aquaculture a sustainable source of protein for US consumers in the 2020s?

- technology is there
- growth is there
- sustainable?
  - unchanged? no
  - more research
    - Anderson: need economists
    - Lam: need more ethics

$$\text{How are you setting up your paper?}$$

- Lam 2016 states that "Aquaculture supplied 42 % of the world’s fish in 2012 and is forecast to eclipse capture fisheries production by 2030." 
- Anderson et al. 2019 agree but note that economists haven't been as influencial on respective policies
- Costa-Pierce 2012 offers hope about the sustainability.

# Critical Literature Review

$$\text{What do you expect to say about your minimum 3 outside sources?}$$

### What is Aquaculture?

Costa-Pierce 2012

- Polyculture
  - two or more noncompetitive species
  - enhance total production
  - *efficent land-use*
- explore models
  - IMTA & SEA
  - creating ecological systems
    - recycle waste and use natural filtration

Lam 2016

- cultivation under controlled conditions

### Sustainable?

Anderson et al 2019

- half the world uses aquaculture for fish consumption
  - expected to increase to 2/3rds by 2030
- growth of industry $\rightarrow$ success story of produciton technologies
  - most production occurs overseas
  - US is primarly an importer
- concerns
  - pollution
  - ethics (feeding, disease management)
  - habitats
  - food quality/safety

Lam 2016

- supply of fish to market: 3.2% annual growth (vs 1.6% world pop)
- seafood is highest traded global food commodity
- UN Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
  - majority of non-compliance

# Discussion of Findings

$$\text{What are some of your anticipated findings? What are you drawing from your research?}$$

- Anderson et al. 2019 and Lam 2016 both agree that world food needs are a problem, and if aquaculture can be done sustainably, it offers a major solution. 
- Costa-Pierce claims sustainable systems like IMTA & SEA are the economic solution due to reduced overhead costs

> Anderson et al. discuss the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and its rising dominance for supplying the global food market. The US is now a major importer of sea food due to explicit bans on aquaculture in various coastal states and subsquently does not fund much economic research into this area. The authors advocate strongly for more inclusion of natural resource economists in the discussions of policy to better inform viability and sustainability of aquaculture for the fishery/aquaculture sectors. There are pollution, ethical, and safety concerns about current techniques and mangement of aquacultures but very limited research has examined these areas.

> The author for the encylopedia entry briefly discusses the history of aquaculture and showcases two promising current models: IMTA and SEA. These models are designed to be ecologically sustainable first and offer economic benefits as a result: diversification of product (and risk), efficient *land* use, and ethical benefits. Costa-Pierce reviews the adoption and spread of current aquaculture technology along coastal waters along with their costs and benefits.

> The author considers the steady increase in (global) seafood demand in contrast to declining wild fish stocks. In light of this issue, Lam highlights the lack of a previous analysis and subsequently provides a quanlitative analysis of the ethics and sustainability of both capture fisheries and aquaculture. They review case studies on how large and small scale capture fisheries and aquacultures have effected ecosystems, policies, and consumers. Their conclusion is that small-scale fisheries are more sustainable than large-scale and that omnivorous aquaculture systems are more ethical than carnivorous systems.
