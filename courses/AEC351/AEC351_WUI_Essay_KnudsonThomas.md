# Introduction

> **Prompt** Is the frequency of large, costly, and dangerous wildfires affecting communities at the wildland-urban interface (WUI) around the world expected to increase this century? If so, what are some economically-efficient strategies for adapting to WUI communities?

$$\text{Is the frequency of wildfires expected to increase?}\rightarrow\text{Yes}$$

Use Schoennagel et al. 2017 to set up agreement with prompt:

- Observed
  - increased freq. in fires
    - 1000% in NW, and rest of US
    - 300% average annual number of structures
- Predictions
  - even more; 40% of WUI expected to experience moderate to large incr in probability of wildifre over next 20 years

# Critical Literature Review

$$\text{What do you expect to say about your minimum 3 outside sources?}$$

## WUI

What is? what is included?

- Johnston et al. 2020 entry on **\gls{wui}**
  - "the area where houses and other structures are built within or close to wildland vegetation"
  - e.g. Nick's house in Lebabanon is in the \gls{wui}
    - In a moderate forest, edge of city
  - Cite/reference Figure 1 from page 1169 of pdf as examples of \gls{wui}
  - Consider Figure 3, page 1172

- Schoennagel et al. 2017
  - increase in \gls{wui} area

## Climate Change

- Increase in fires
- Schoennagel 2017
  - Homogeneous forests are in danger of being converted to non-forest
  - early snowmelt and longer fire season
  - thinning $\rightarrow$ reduces fire severity but harms ecological resilence

## Strategies

Johnston et al. 2020

- Firefighting Chemicals
  - Retardants
  - water enchancers
- Fuel Treatments
  - alter fuel to reduce fire severity and/or behaviour

# Discussion of Findings

$$\text{What are some of your anticipated findings? What are you drawing from your research?}$$

Use Rasker as an exmaple of continuing old paradigms (i.e., Schoennagel et al. 2017 argues about)

- Solutions are to reduce costs by economic means

Contrast with suggestions from Schoennagel et al. 2017

  - Not a specific solution, but a change in mentality towards a solution
  - avoids "head in sand" approach from most of Rasker's proposals
  - agree about education in WUI areas

Rasker 2009

- National Fire Insurance and Mortgage Program
  - Flood insurance helps a little bit, but current implmentation is flawed
    - Depending on the depth of the arguement, will need to include additional sources
- Redirect Land Use through:
  - Zoning
  - Acquisition

Schoennagel et al. 2017

- Shift paradigm
  - from fire suppression to fuel build up
    - Johnston et al. 2020 entry on **Wildland Firefighting Chemicals** might help provide additional context
  - reactive $\rightarrow$ pro-active
- Increase burning
  - Climate consequences?
    - smoke $\rightarrow$ health concerns
  - reduces fuel
  - focus on areas of drought and warming
- fuel management
  - forests
  - around \gls{wui}
    - change building materials

> The authors review how the current, as of publication in 2017, wildfire policy and management has not adapted to changing circumstances in \glspl{ses}. Schoennagel et al. stress the importance of adopting an *adaptive resilience* to wildfires by highlighting the 1000% increase in frequency of large fires in the Northwestern forests since the 1970s. Predictably, the annual economic damage suffered in the \gls{wui} has increased by 300% since 1990. The authors also caution of worsening conditons due to climate change (early snowmelt leading to longer fire seasons) and lack of forest fuel maitenance.
