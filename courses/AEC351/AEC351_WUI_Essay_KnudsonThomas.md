# Introduction

> **Prompt** Is the frequency of large, costly, and dangerous wildfires affecting communities at the wildland-urban interface (WUI) around the world expected to increase this century? If so, what are some economically-efficient strategies for adapting to wildfires affecting WUI communities?

$$\text{How are you setting up your paper?}$$

- Yeah, we're screwed.

# Critical Literature Review

$$\text{What do you expect to say about your minimum 3 outside sources?}$$

## WUI

- What is? what is included?
- Nick's House?

## Climate Change

- Increase in fires

# Discussion of Findings

$$\text{What are some of your anticipated findings? What are you drawing from your research?}$$
