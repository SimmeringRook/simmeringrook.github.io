## Project Summary

We will study the equations of motion for massive and massless particles in the presence of curved spacetime. A Schwarzschild black hole will serve as the source of curvature for analysis of limiting cases that will be used as the foundation for sense making and error checking in computational runtimes.

The analysis of the kinematics objects traversing any geometry of spacetime is a fundamentally complicated and abstract process. Not only does the Physicist have to reset their Classical expectations and intuitions about the perceived order of events, duration of time, and length of distances measured in the context of spacetime, but they must also adopt a whole new suite of complex and compact notation. As a result, the representation for equations of motion take on an extremely foreign and difficult to interpret form. By creating a computational framework to wrangle these geodesic equations, we can provide a more accessible and intuitive interpretation for the trajectories of both massive and massless particles moving about a curved spacetime. The curvature of this spacetime will be generated by a single massive object with initial parameters matching the description of a Schwarzschild black hole, but the toolset will not be constrained to just the local regions about the black hole. The framework will be able to calculate and display the differential scattering cross sections of particles with variable parameters as they attempt to orbit the black hole and are either captured or flung free. In addition, velocity and acceleration vector field representations for each specified particle will be generated to map out local and global regions of the spacetime to assist in normalizing the Physicist's intuition in these extreme environments.

Time permitting, the codebase will be refined to be modular and well documented, with a particular addition focus on extendibility. This framework is intended to be integrated into similar codebases, such as either the Stardisk or Chimera projects. The underlying latticework of grid points will be implemented without assumptions of the underlying properties for the geometry of spacetime to facilitate straightforward modular extension for more complicated spacetimes such as the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m or Kerr geometries.

### Timeline

This project has an immovable deadline of: Week 6 in Spring Term 2022. In order to meet this deadline, two major milestone deadlines have been created: one in Fall Term (2021) and one in Winter Term (2022).

The first Milestone is the completion of the Thesis Project Proposal and subsequent agreement by all involved parties that the project meets acceptable scope and requirements for the WIC requirement for a BSc in Physics. The timeframe of one year, Spring 2020 to 2021, was allotted for background research into General Relativity using literature sources and through courses offered by Oregon State University. Initial project concepts were outlined and tested during this timeframe as metrics for gauging understanding of relevant concepts. Week 0 through Week 6 of the Fall 2021 term have been assigned for finial project synthesis and formulation of Thesis Proposal.

The second Milestone is Week 6 of the Winter 2022 Term and is denoted by the completion of the Thesis document. Week 6 of Fall 2021 to January 2022 are earmarked for the code implementation and testing of the framework. Documentation of functionality will occur concurrently to aide in the drafting of the Thesis document, alongside additional literature review. MVP of framework should exist prior to finals week of Fall 2021 to allow for ample debugging and refactoring.

### Data Management & Materials/Equipment

To facilitate fast prototyping and quick iterations, Python 3 will be used as the base language for creation of the minimal viable product. The language is lightweight enough to allow for design, debugging, and testing to occur on a home computer. Ultimately this code base will be optimized to run on the HPC to allow for higher resolution plots (more expensive in terms of computational run time). A GitHub repository will serve as a version control source for the codebase throughout the lifetime of the project and as an off-site backup of work as the project continues. The repository can be expanded upon to document code functionality to both aide in the writing of the thesis and in the future usability of the framework.
