# Project Overview

## Goals

Create a visualization toolset for increasing the accessibility and understandability for trajectories moving through spacetime. This toolset will be able to produce vector field plots for trajectories of objects moving throughout non-Euclidian space through solved geodesic equations of motion. Also, the toolset will be able to generate the corresponding differential scattering cross section for a particle with specified parameters of Energy and (Orbital) angular momentum.

Time permitting, the codebase will be modular and well documented, allowing for integration into similar codebases, such as either the Stardisk or Chimera projects. The underlying latticework of grid points will be implemented without assumptions of the geometry of spacetime to allow straightforward modular use with more complicated spacetimes being introduced in the future such as the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m or Kerr geometries.

## Materials/Equipment

To facilitate fast prototyping and quick iterations, Python 3 will be used as the base language for creation of the minimal viable product. The language is lightweight enough to allow for design, debugging, and testing to occur on a home computer. Ultimately this code base will be optimized to run on the HPC to allow for higher resolution plots (more expensive in terms of computational run time). A GitHub repository will serve as a version control source for the codebase throughout the lifetime of the project and as an off-site backup of work as the project continues. The repository can be expanded upon to document code functionality to both aide in the writing of the thesis and in the future usability of the framework.

## Timeline

This project has an immovable deadline of: Week 6 in Spring Term 2022. In order to meet this deadline, two major milestone deadlines have been created: one in Fall Term (2021) and one in Winter Term (2022).

The first Milestone is the completion of the Thesis Project Proposal and subsequent agreement by all involved parties that the project meets acceptable scope and requirements for the WIC requirement for a BSc in Physics. The timeframe of one year, Spring 2020 to 2021, was allotted for background research into General Relativity using literature sources and through courses offered by Oregon State University. Initial project concepts were outlined and tested during this timeframe as metrics for gauging understanding of relevant concepts. Week 0 through Week 6 of the Fall 2021 term have been assigned for finial project synthesis and formulation of Thesis Proposal.

The second Milestone is Week 6 of the Winter 2022 Term and is denoted by the completion of the Thesis document. Week 6 of Fall 2021 to January 2022 are earmarked for the code implementation and testing of the framework. Documentation of functionality will occur concurrently to aide in the drafting of the Thesis document, alongside additional literature review. MVP of framework should exist prior to finals week of Fall 2021 to allow for ample debugging and refactoring.
