# PH 585: Atomic Molecular Optical Physics


#### Day 0

Brief History and Overview:
- Blackbody Radiation
  - Ultraviolet Catastrophe
  - $E_n = nh\nu$
- Models of the Atom
  - Plumb pudding
    - smeared out positive charge
    - no idea about Protons
    - Ernest Rutherford performed the experiment that required a new model
      - most particles went through the gold foil
      - few were reflected
      - implies core that was concentrated such that alpha particles were deflected
  - Bohr Model
- Emission and Absorption Spectra
- Particle Wave Duality
  - De Broglie
  - $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} \Leftrightarrow p\lambda = h$
  - Diffraction and interference patterns for electrons
- Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Looking ahead:
- Day 1
  - build the electromagnetic toolbox
  - quantize the field
    - take the classical EM wave and write as Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
    - $\vec{A}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{A_0}{2}\hat{\epsilon}\exp{ikr-\omega t}$
- Day 2
  - build the quantum mechanical toolbox
  - how to make the quantized EM field interact with matter
    - Take Lorentz force and what is the equivalent Hamiltonian
    - $\vec{F}_{EM} = q(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B}) \rightarrow \hat{H}$
    - **Question:** How does an EM-field interact with matter?
      - Assumptions:
        - no sources (just the field; not dealing with point charges)
        - field described by $\vec{A}$ and $\Phi$
          - $\vec{A}\rightarrow$ vector potential (for B-field)
          - $\Phi\rightarrow$ scalar potential (for E-field)
      - Goal:
        - $H_{EM}=\frac{1}{2m}(\vec{p}-q\vec{A})^2+q\Phi$
- Day 3
  - time-dependent perturbation theory
  - QM that you can get paid to do
    - [ab initio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) electronic
    - absorption, cross-section $\sigma$
    - NMR/MRI
