## Week 1
### Day 1

#### Simple Harmonic Motion

Discussing the equations of motion for a system undergoing SHM using the *A-form* solution as a base example:
$$x(t)=A\cos{(\omega t+\phi)}$$

- $f$ is the cyclic frequency
  - dimensions of $\frac{1}{time}$
  - units of $s^{-1}$, $Hz$
- $\omega$ is the [angular frequency](/physics/AngularFrequency.md)
  - dimensions of $\frac{1}{time}$
  - units of $radians\ s^{-1}$
- $A$ is the amplitude of motion
  - dimensions of the corresponding system
    - E.g., If we're talking about position as a function of time, the amplitude has dimensions of $length$
  - $2A$ is the peak-to-peak displacement
    - total *distance* of *peak* to *valley*
    - this type of *amplitude* needs to be specified, as normal convention is to refer to just $A$ when discussing the amplitude of the system
- $\phi$ is the phase angle
  - Allows adjustments for specifying any initial conditions beyond $A$ at $t=0$

Initial Conditions
 - completely determine equations of motion

### Day 2

- Practice determining ABCD-forms with given initial conditions
