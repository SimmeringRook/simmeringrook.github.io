## Week 1
### Day 1

#### Simple Harmonic Motion

Discussing the equations of motion for a system undergoing SHM using the *A-form* solution as a base example:
$$x(t)=A\cos{(\omega t+\phi)}$$

- $f$ is the cyclic frequency
  - dimensions of $\frac{1}{time}$
  - units of $s^{-1}$, $Hz$
- $\omega$ is the [angular frequency](/physics/AngularFrequency.md)
  - dimensions of $\frac{1}{time}$
  - units of $radians\ s^{-1}$
- $A$ is the amplitude of motion
  - dimensions of the corresponding system
    - E.g., If we're talking about position as a function of time, the amplitude has dimensions of $length$
  - $2A$ is the peak-to-peak displacement
    - total *distance* of *peak* to *valley*
    - this type of *amplitude* needs to be specified, as normal convention is to refer to just $A$ when discussing the amplitude of the system
- $\phi$ is the phase angle
  - Allows adjustments for specifying any initial conditions beyond $A$ at $t=0$

Initial Conditions
 - completely determine equations of motion

### Day 2

- Practice determining ABCD-forms with given initial conditions

Given the following general initial conditions:
- $x_0=x(t=0)$
- $v_0=\dot{x}(t=0)$

#### A-form
We can then take the (time) derivative of our position function to obtain an expression for velocity as a function of time:

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{d}{dt}\left(A\cos{(\omega_0 t+\phi)}\right) &= -A\omega_0\sin{(\omega_0 t+\phi)}\\
\dot{x}(t) &= -\omega_0 A\sin{(\omega_0 t+\phi)}\end{aligned}$$

Then we equate our initial conditions:
$$\begin{aligned}
x(t=0) &= A\cos{(\omega_0\cdot0+\phi)}\\
x_0 &= A\cos{(\phi)}
\\ \\
\dot{x}(t=0) &= -\omega_0 A\sin{(\omega_0\cdot 0+\phi)}\\
v_0 &= -\omega_0 A\sin{(\phi)}\end{aligned}$$

We can manipulate these two equations to find ways to solve for $A$ and $\phi$ given the initial conditions of $x_0$ and $v_0$.
- To obtain the expression for $A$, we can square both equations and add them:
$$\begin{aligned}
{x_0}^2+\frac{{v_0}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} &= A^2(\sin^2{\phi}+\cos^2{\phi}) \\
A^2 &= {x_0}^2+\frac{{v_0}^2}{{\omega_0}^2} \\
A &= \sqrt{{x_0}^2+\frac{{v_0}^2}{{\omega_0}^2}}\\
A &= x_0\sqrt{1+\frac{{v_0}^2}{{x_0}^2 {\omega_0}^2}}
\end{aligned}$$

- To obtain the expression for $\phi$, we then just divide both equations:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{v_0}{x_0} &= \frac{-\omega_0 A\sin{(\phi)}}{A\cos{(\phi)}} \\
\frac{v_0}{x_0} &= -\omega_0\tan{\phi}\\
\tan{\phi} &= -\frac{v_0}{\omega_0 x_0}\\
\phi &= \arctan{\left(-\frac{v_0}{\omega_0 x_0}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$

#### B-form
Given the B-form, we have the position as a function of time given by:

$$x(t)=B_p\cos{(\omega_0 t)}+B_q\sin{(\omega_0 t)}$$

And so, taking the (time) derivative gives us velocity as a function of time:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dt}x(t) &= -\omega_0 B_p\sin{(\omega_0 t)} + \omega_0B_q\cos{(\omega_0 t)} \\ \dot{x}(t) &= -\omega_0 B_p\sin{(\omega_0 t)} + \omega_0B_q\cos{(\omega_0 t)}\end{aligned}
$$

Now let us explore these equations when $t=0$:

$$\begin{aligned}
x(t=0) &= B_p\cos{(\omega_0\cdot 0)}+B_q\sin{(\omega_0\cdot 0)}\\
x_0 &= B_p \\
\\ \\
\dot{x}(t=0) &= -\omega_0 B_p\sin{(\omega_0\cdot 0)} + \omega_0 B_q\cos{(\omega_0\cdot 0)}\\
v_0 &= \omega_0 B_q
\end{aligned}
$$

And we can relate this form to the A-form through the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
x_0 &= A\cos(\phi) = B_p \\
v_0 &= A\omega_0\sin(\phi) = \omega_0 B_q \\
\\
A\cos(\phi) &= B_p \\
A\omega_0\sin(\phi) &= \omega_0 B_q
\end{aligned}$$

Using the same methods as when solving the A-form for $A$ and $\phi$, we relate $B_p$ and $B_q$ to $A$ and $\phi$:

$$\begin{aligned}
A^2 &= {B_p}^2 + {B_q}^2 \\
\tan{(\phi)} &= -\frac{B_q}{B_p}
\end{aligned}$$

#### C-form

The third way we can represent position as a function of time for [SHM](/physics/SimpleHarmonicMotion.md) is by using complex numbers:

$$x(t)=C e^{i\omega_0 t}+C^* e^{-i\omega_0 t}$$

Where:
- $C$ is a complex number

Much more simply, the amplitude can be found by adding the conjugate to its complex value, e.g:
$$(a+bi)+(a-bi)=2a$$
