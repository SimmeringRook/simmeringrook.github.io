# PH 424: Oscillations and Waves

### Week 1
#### Day 1

Simple Harmonic Motion

$$x(t)=A\cos{\omega t+\phi}$$

- $f$ is the cyclic frequency
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency
- $A$ is the amplitude of motion
  - $2A$ is the peak-to-peak displacement
- $\phi$ is the phase angle

Initial Conditions
 - completely determine equations of motion
