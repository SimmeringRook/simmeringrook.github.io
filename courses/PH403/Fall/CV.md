*Final year, individual project*

* Utilized independent research skills and combined course knowledge to create a dynamic webpage that could add or retrieve data from hosted database
* User interface created with HTML and CSS
* Communication with the SQLite DBMS facilitated by PHP
* Assisted classmates with debugging and testing of their projects

<br />

*Final year, group project*

Recipe management tool that updated inventory of ingredients to simplify meal planning and grocery shopping.

* Created Windows desktop application using C# with SQL Server local instance
* Exercised project management skills by using the Waterfall methodology
* Encouraged through planning before efficient division of labor which led to project completion well before deadline

## Projects

**Searching for the Point of Lethality of a Black Hole by Gravitational Gradient**

*Independent, 2014-2019*

The goal of this independent project was to find at what distance from a Black Hole was the force of Gravity so strong that it would be lethal. This required enormous tenacity as the highest level of Mathematical and Physical knowledge during most of this project was obtained during High School. Various methods were used to approximate the answer to this question before using General Relativity. Valuable skills learned along the way:

* Understanding the importance of the construction of approximate models and their constraints
* Sense making and determining the validity of results
* How to reevaluate project goals and pursue a topic without an Advisor

## Honors and Awards

* Dean's List (years)
* Army Achievement Medal in 2013 for demonstrating superior motivation, knowledge, willingness to learn, all while teaching junior soldiers.
* 2 Certificates of Achievement (Army)
  * in 2011 for quickly mastering new skills and demonstrating a high level of determination and motivation during a training exercise
  *	in 2012 for graduating in the top 20% of the class (Commandant's List) from Warrior Leader's Course (Leadership training school)

## Employment

**Undergraduate Learning Assistant**

*2020 - Present*

* Assisted Professors in the preparation of lectures and group activities.
* Guided students in comprehension of topics during lectures, activities, and office hours.
* Communicated and advocated for student needs to Graduate Teaching Assistant and Professor during 5 week intensive courses.

**Airborne Combat Engineer (12B1P)**

*2010 - 2014, United States Army*

*	Identify, construct, and improve strategic defense locations including bridges, roads, and obstacles, in support of Infantry units.
*	Trained in the preparation, installation, and use of explosives for demolition, including firing systems.
*	Assisted and coached peers in the startup, installation and troubleshooting of vehicle communications and defense systems.
