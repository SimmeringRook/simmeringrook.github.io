## Projects

### Undergraduate Thesis in Physics, OSU

2020 - 2022, (Computational, General Relativity)

Advisor: Kathryn Hadley, PhD

A computational framework was developed to generate visualizations describing the curved spacetime the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations. The visualizations describing the motion and path of massless and low-mass objects were generated using Python. A primary goal of this project was to create a framework that following students could expand upon which required self-descriptive code and documentation.

* Refined skills in defining scope and project management
* Developed a wide array of resources and deeper understanding of General Relativity and Programming
* Improved communication about complex topics and adjusting for audience

### Independent Project, Self

2014 - 2019, *Searching for the Point of Lethality of a Black Hole by Gravitational Gradient* 

The goal of this independent project was to find at what distance from a Black Hole was the force of Gravity so strong that it would be lethal. This required enormous tenacity as the highest level of Mathematical and Physical knowledge during most of this project was obtained during High School. Various methods were used to approximate the answer to this question before using General Relativity. Valuable skills learned along the way:

* Understanding the importance of the construction of approximate models and their constraints
* Sense making and determining the validity of results
* How to reevaluate project goals and pursue a topic without an Advisor

### Capstone Programming Projects, FTCC

*Final year, individual project*

* Utilized independent research skills and combined course knowledge to create a dynamic webpage that could add or retrieve data from hosted database
* User interface created with HTML and CSS
* Communication with the SQLite DBMS facilitated by PHP
* Assisted classmates with debugging and testing of their projects

<br />

*Final year, group project*

Recipe management tool that updated inventory of ingredients to simplify meal planning and grocery shopping.

* Created Windows desktop application using C# with SQL Server local instance
* Exercised project management skills by using the Waterfall methodology
* Encouraged through planning before efficient division of labor which led to project completion well before deadline

## Honors and Awards

* Honor Roll: 2020, 2021
* Army Achievement Medal in 2013 for demonstrating superior motivation, knowledge, willingness to learn, all while teaching junior soldiers.
* 2 Certificates of Achievement (Army)
  * in 2011 for quickly mastering new skills and demonstrating a high level of determination and motivation during a training exercise
  *	in 2012 for graduating in the top 20% of the class (Commandant's List) from Warrior Leader's Course (Leadership training school)
