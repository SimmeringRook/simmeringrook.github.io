## Overview
On one hand, the revised project and subsquent proposal submitted is completely different from the original rough concept from a few weeks ago. As far as actual written content, the project has changed in scope from investigations of trajectories of low-mass particles about a Schwarschild black hole using the differential scattering cross section to creating a toolset that allows easily created visualizations of those trajectories with comparisions against Newtonian predicitions. Personally, these are two completely different projects in my mind. As a result, I haven't directly used any feedback provided on the draft (as I don't think any of the content in this submission is carried over from the first iteration), but I did use the feedback from our verbal conversation during the meeting to help guide the iterations that led to what is being submitted.

I guess in some sense, I made myself do more work than necessary, but I found it easier to iterate on draft versions by resynthizing most of the content from scratch with a different mindset and only trying to copy sections from a previous version that were very strong or key. I've cannibalized part of my response to Dr. Tate's request of a process memo for HW 4 to add some additional context.

### What is going well? What do you like about your proposal draft?

Having a clear understanding of the project and what it entails has drastically helped quick iterations to flush out a majority of the content. I am happily content with the Plan of Work, Timeline, and other sections. I was able to repurpose some figures I made for discussing the implementation of my project (Fig 1 and Fig 2) to add into the core of the Plan of Work and give, what feels like, a nice visual touch to: "I need to spend some time mocking out what this internal structure is going to look like".

### What is difficult?

The Project Summary and Introduction might be the weakest portions. I initally wanted to use the Introduction to really sell the in-accessibility of GR to the average physicist, and I spent a lot of time building up to that. Per Dr. Tate's recommendation, I trimmed down some extra sections (saved for the Thesis) to increase the pace a little bit.

I really would have liked to include a figure or two in the Introduction section, but I couldn't find a way to make it work without slowing down the pacing too much and/or talking about a feature/problem of GR that I wasn't planning on directly addressing with the project/Thesis. Would've been great to have that "popular media" reference for some of the 'wackiness' of GR.

The summary didn't get too much love in its revisions as I was more focused on the rest of the content. I was happy with it, but did remove/reword a few things. If more time was permitted, I would have liked to spend a little bit longer refining the summary, but I think it gets the gist of the point across. It didn't have to cover everything, but I do think it could've been just a tad bit stronger.
