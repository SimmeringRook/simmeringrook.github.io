# Project Summary

Using various models of spacetime, we will endeavor to determine the minimum stable orbit for a collection of neutrinos above the event horizon of a series of increasingly complicated black holes. By solving the geodesic equations for each spacetime, we can discuss the trajectories of the neutrinos and whether or not they correspond to a stable and circular orbit. There already exists the notion that light can establish a stable circular orbit just above the event horizon, where each wave/photon will remain until the black hole expands/contracts and alters the trajectory of the trapped light. In an equilibrium situation, this light will be trapped for eternity and form a complete spherical shell that an observer could only grasp a flash of as they descend into the black hole. This will be analyzed by plotting the impact parameter versus the angle of incidence to discover valid geodesics for neutrinos.

# Project Description

## Introduction

Neutrinos, given their small mass and weak interaction with matter, form an excellent test particle for use in examining orbital behaviour. The deeper understanding we have of interactions of particles near the event horizon of a black hole, the better we can improve and/or optimize our models and numeric solutions to multi-body systems in the framework of General Relativity. The treatment of neutrinos in a Schwarzschild geometry sets an excellent stage for comparing the results of the more complicated models against and will begin by exploring valid parameters of energy and orbital angular momentum for a circular geodesic described by Equation \ref{circ-orbit} below[1].

\begin{equation}\label{circ-orbit}\left(\frac{dr}{d\tau}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{E}{m}\right)^2 - \left(1 - \frac{2M}{r}\right)\left(1+\frac{(L/m)^{2}}{r^{2}}\right)\end{equation}
