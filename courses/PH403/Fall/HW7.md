> Subject: Memo responding to the Replication Crisis and relation to the Beasly report

$$\ $$

As the majority of Faculty should recall, in 2002 Bell Labs formed an internal invesitgation committee to investigate the validity of claims regarding Hendrik Schoen's scientific misconduct. The result is colloquially referred to as the 'Beasley report', a 129-page document detailing claims, findings, and the conclusions of the committee. The committee's findings and conclusion of explicit scientific misconduct lead to many institutions revising and publishing new standards of ethics to curtail similar instances occuring.

I write to you all today as another scandal wreaks havoc on the scientific community: the 'Replication Crisis'. Over the past few months, publicity has been increasing on a wide array of published papers and the efficacy of their results. While the greater scientific community was spurred into action following Schoen's actions and Bell Labs' release of the report, we, as a profession, are once again faced with questionable research. At best, the author's have overstated the certainty in their findings and at worst, a willful misrepresentation of data and conclusions.

While the community, and each association, explore the fullest extent of these claims, our institution can make progress to limiting similar cases from arising in the future. A revisment of the ethical policy for more clearly drawn boundaries may be necessary, but it is not a sufficient solution in and of itself. One of the earliest parts of the scientific method we teach to children in Elementary school and reinforce throughout their academic careers is the important of reproducibility.

To this end, I propose we develop department programs to begin verifying the reproducibility of experiments. These experiments should be conducted under the supervision of an instructor, but can be carried out by both graduate and undergraduate students as a means to further their experience and knowledge of the sciences beyond carefully crafted and simplified lab exercises. To this end, the college has arranged for a townhall meeting in one months time, December 3rd, for discussion about these events and the impacts to our policies and work. I encourage you to speak with your collueages and students about meaningful implementations to regain the trust of the public and to uphold the search for scientific truth.

Sincerely,

$$\ $$
