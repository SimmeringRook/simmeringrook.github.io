I choose to focus on the third section which talks about subordinates and their well-being. Student employees are extremely vulnerable to incomplete implementations of these policies. The onus is typically placed on the student to advocate for themselves not only in class but also with respect to employment from the same set of professors. While navigating how to advocate for yourself is a useful life lesson to learn, as it applies to situations beyond academia, it seems to contradict the first recommended implementation from APS:

  "Subordinates should always be treated with respect and with concern for their well-being. Their supervisors have the responsibility to facilitate their research, educational, and professional development, to ensure they have the knowledge and training to perform their work safely, to promote their timely advancement to the next stage of career development, and to provide a supportive working environment and fair compensation."

Supervisors demonstrating concern for their subordinates is manifested through consistent and clear communication. E.g. subordinates shouldn't have to advocate for themselves; their supervisor should already be aware and acting proactively. Most students are still young and relatively inexperienced. They don't know what reasonable requests and commitments are, that they can say no, or that under-reporting hours only hurts themselves. They shouldn't feel that the motivation for helping students and professors out of concern for their well-being is something to be avoided, but they need to understand that they are being paid to do a job.

For some reason, we all seem to acknowledge and jest that graduate students are over-worked and/or paid inadequately for their responsibilities. Undergraduate employees experience similar treatment and quietly express the same concerns but do nothing, either unmotivated by the power imbalance or complacency. A lot has changed over the past decade, especially with respect to recognizing bias, harassment, and discrimination, but the gap has grown between the treatment of students and student employees. 

Tuition has doubled since I first took college courses a decade ago: [UNLV Cost of Credit per Hour](https://catalog.unlv.edu/content.php?catoid=1&navoid=47) vs [OSU Cost of Credit per Hour](https://fa.oregonstate.edu/budget/tuition-fees/2021-2022-tuition-fee-schedules).

> Supervisors must clearly understand their responsibilities in creating an environment where all individuals can feel safe and succeed.

The most egregious violation of this is in the mentalities of subordinates and supervisors: complacency with the status quo. This correlates with a particular sore spot from my experiences with the Military. The most dangerous aspect of my job of searching for improvised explosive devices was actually within my own control: complacency.
