## What is going well? What do you like about your proposal draft?

Having a clear understanding of the project and what it entails has drastically helped quick iterations to flush out a majority of the content. I think in a general sense, the Introduction should be done as far as synthesis is concerned. The timeline feels very through and some of that might need to be cannibalized back into the Plan of Work to avoid too much repetition. While not extremely important, the time spent making the waterfall charts for both the project and Thesis were very helpful in externalizing the process into sequential chunks.

## What is difficult? How do you plan to address the difficulties?

The difficult part right now is the synthesis for the Plan of Work: I understand we are supposed to go into detail here, but its a bit hard to avoid talking about the inner workings in broad strokes as I don't exactly know how the puzzle pieces will snap into place. Hopefully as I mock up and actually begin iteration on the project itself later this week, this part will be more clear and I'll have better figures to add for this section and/or more refined (but still broad) notions of each phase.

## In what areas would a reviewer's comments be most helpful to you? (Also least helpful, if that is relevant?)

Least helpful:

- Comments on the lack of figures/equations won't really be helpful as I've specifically avoided spending time on that portion. The focus since I've been able to truly start working on this (10/15) has been all about synthesis of content.
- Not concerned with any feedback about:
  - Cover page. It is set in stone by template.
  - CV. Can and will be iterated on in the future; Proposal is more important.
  - References. I haven't added everything yet, format is dictated by template.

Most helpful:

- Flow of the introduction.
  - I know that I haven't *really* explained what a lot of the stuff is, but I think I've reached the limit of what I would want to put in there. The concepts should be called out enough that the reader could do their own research. The thesis will have more room and I'll be able to devote more space (and time) to introducing these concepts in the body of the work (or Appendix).
- Plan of Work
  - On the content that is there: How well is the gist of the project and steps being communicated? I know the computational aspect is going to be vague and foreign, and I'm not assuming the audience will be able to build their own mental structure of the toolset: but how well does the puzzle start synthesizing in your own mind? Can you see the big pieces I'm thinking about and start coming up with your own representation if you were tasked with this?
  - It's going to be hard, since a majority of the work at this stage is really just focusing on the computational aspect, but are there any suggestions on how to better highlight the physics in these parts? (Reference the 3 phases discussed in the Timeline for ideas on Phase 2 and 3).
