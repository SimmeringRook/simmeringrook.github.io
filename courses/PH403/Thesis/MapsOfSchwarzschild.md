# Maps of Schwarzschild

## Distance, Time, and Embedding Diagrams

> TODO: This sets the stage for more complex plots and visualizations to come.

> TODO: Figure plotting proper time/distance as measured by each shell.

> TODO: This is also the place to call out what appears to be the standard formatting for these type of plots.

## Gaining Speed and Radial Geodesics

> TODO: Embedding diagram with geodesic plotted and corresponding callout.

> TODO: Speed as measured from different observers.

### Rain versus Hail

> TODO: Rain frame (rest at infinity) versus Hail frame (initial speed) as measured from different observers.

## Angular Momentum, Effective Potential, and Orbits

> TODO: Potential vs r-coordinate

### Circular

> TODO: Limiting cases

### Eliptical 

> TODO: Precession of Mercury
