This thesis was written with a OSU physics major starting their capstone courses in mind. While
not uniformly true for all physics students, base concepts of astrophysics and relativity, as would
be covered in PH 455: Astrophysics and PH 335: Theoretical Mechanics, are treated as prior
knowledge. Advanced concepts from general relativity or programming & optimization (beyond PH
36X: Computational Lab) will be explained or given an explicit appendix reference.


## Motivation

Special relativity introduces the notion that not all observers measure the same quantities. A vast majority of models in classical and modern physics can be explored using the intuitive framework of Galiean relativity. It is only when we begin to consider extreme situations ("the not everyday experiences") that we need to redefine our models. Classically
