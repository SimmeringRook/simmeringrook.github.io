I've recently discovered that Section 3.2 does not have the nice solution I was hoping to acheive in that its not physically possible to describe. As a result, I'm not sure if I will want to keep it around: the function works as is, but is decieving in the information it provides. Maybe move to an appendix?

I've attempted to re-add motivation to the Introduction section giving an insight into what the project does. In a sense, I'm trying to be brief as the background will review relevant concepts more in depth, but not sure if it hits the spot without being repetitive.

For the peer review, I guess the feedback I'd like to hear how well Section 3 flows. Not every detail can be explained, and I'm trying to find the balance between directing the reader to other sources which discuss the topics in more detail than I can provide in the thesis. If you run into a bits where you don't think the background prepared you (Section 2.1) and you feel lost, comments around that area would be helpful, as I may have implied something or it may need a more explicit reference to other sources.

Part of my hope is that upon finishing the example in the introduction, the reader would be intrigued to examine other physical situations: how good of a job did I do in inspiring curiousity?
