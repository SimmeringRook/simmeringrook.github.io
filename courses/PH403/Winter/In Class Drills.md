> What do we know now that we didn't before we started doing my work?

I am astounded at how much confusion there is about the time dilation for the GPS satellites. The general public, sure; but the scientific community, I figured this example was prime for communicating examples of Newtonian mechanics failing. It's also super difficult to convey to people who are knowledable about the respective concepts: the amount of times I've had to reframe the explaination to Tevian and Kathy is much greater than I expected.

There is no easy way to use the standard tools to describe this situation:

    Draw a picture -> Spacetime diagram -> very ugly and complicated to do for Schwarzschild.

I still don't have a expert way to describe it.

> What evidence have I presented? How have I linked this to introduction and set up?

Well, I am using this example in the introduction to set the context for the paper.

I have lots of equations that just increase in complexity. Things get even more complicated as I try to explore what are supposed to be similar situations.

I need something to test.

I need to talk about changing frames in the background.
