## What was the most significant or recurring feedback you received and how did you act on it (or say why not)?

The majority of recurring feedback pre-Assignment 5 was the lack of explaination of motivation for the project. I think with the introduction of the Introduction section, I have more by-in from readers initially compared to the proof-by-intimidation style carried over from the proposal. However, while the story is more coherent and approachable, I sacrificed any disucssion of Cartographer. Most feedback post-Assignment 5 has been about this lack of information. I have attempted to add in a paragraph towards the end which works towards explaining the grander context before the explicit road map of concepts to be discussed.

This section is still a bit weak with regards to differential scattering, but I think that is something to revisit when I start flushing out the corresponding results section. Although, at this stage, I don't see what more I would specifically add, as I want the introduction to serve as a motivation and audience setting piece, and I am explicitly treating differential scattering as a subject that will be covered and discussed in the background (as we don't cover it at all in undergrad).

## Reflect on the status of your thesis right now

I've recently discovered that Section 3.2 does not have the nice solution I was hoping to acheive in that its not physically possible to describe. As a result, I'm not sure if I will want to keep it around: the function works as is, but is decieving in the information it provides. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be a very useful exploration in providing additional information to future figures has turned into a bit of a unhelpful detour (and consumed most of my results oriented work this term). For certantity, I know I'll avoid trying to explore it any further until significant (if not all) work is completed in the differential scattering section.

I still have to set aside time to fix some formatting errors in a few of the plots (overlap of tick mark labels, better vertical axis labels, etc) and replace the placeholder versions of Mathematica with Cartographer's output. Baring that, I am very happy with how the introduction has molded over the term and with the illiustrative figures I managed to create to help tell the story.

## What guidance will be most useful to you next term?

As I move into the mixed results-discussion synthesis, I think the biggest problem is going to be in how much detail to elaborate on. On one hand, the mathematical theory and derivation can be found in texts and sourced, but based off the audience I've set for the paper, the results require some level of "this is where this comes from so I can show why we end up with this". I forsee much difficulty in finding the balance in explanation. My current approach as noted with the Assingment 10 Process memo:

>For the peer review, I guess the feedback I'd like to hear how well Section 3 flows. Not every detail can be explained, and I'm trying to find the balance between directing the reader to other sources which discuss the topics in more detail than I can provide in the thesis. If you run into a bits where you don't think the background prepared you (Section 2.1) and you feel lost, comments around that area would be helpful, as I may have implied something or it may need a more explicit reference to other sources.

My short-term plan for moving forward is to work on using more placeholder Mathematica plots, if possible, to add figures for all the corresponding placeholder captions. At least then, I'll be able to work on the bulk of the synthesis in the remaining sections and just revisit with any necessary tweaks once I replace with Cartographer's output. I do introduce the notion of comparing the *exact* solutions as plotted by software like Mathematica versus the numeric approximations from Cartographer in Section 2.2. I might actually want to make that more of a feature moving forward, as it will give more of a comparision to contrast against and something for me to sanity check with as I work on that side of the research. My only fear with this idea is that the formatting of these plots takes an absorbent amount of time, and I'll be effectively doubling it.
