# Revisied Memo

I implemented most of my peer review's changes as they helped reveal what I had and hadn't touched on. I am very happy, at this point, with the Introduction and its two figures to help illiustrate and guide the reader back to the joyful confusion of relativity. I am very pleasently surprised, again through conversations with Christopher (Magone) and Benjamin, at how short the introduce and background for my thesis is shaping up to be.

The arguably worst part of the entire process is how much time goes into tweaking formatting or figures slightly to make it meet the standards or get the visual effect correct. This is extremely unfortunate as each figure is worth so much in conveying information to the reader, but each minute spent on figures is a minute not spent on writing or revisions.

At this stage I feel like I understand more of what the final product is going to look like and with the completetion of Figures 1 and 2, it all feels more in reach than it used to be. Also, the opportunity of spacetime puns/GR jokes seems to be increasing quadraticly with progress.

# Original

Through discussions with Benjamin and Christopher Magone, I think I have a better idea on how to approach the beginning of the thesis. The biggest hurdle has been overcoming rewriting the Introductory section multiple times to avoid writting a textbook. Due to the aforementioned conversations, I think I have a plan forward on how to toe the line on what is necessary and to what extent.

As a result, I think I'll be squashing my methods section into a subsection for the Introduction/Background section. I think consensus has been that it works better as a intro/refresher for computational modeling, but is not explicitly helpful for what is to follow. My plan is to mix results and analysis like Benjamin's thesis (or Hunter Nelson, for example).

As is the case, finding the right amount of time to balance research and writing is very tricky, especially when research has the opportunity to lead you down many dead ends and "waste" many hours (the experience is useful for the future, but does not help alievate deadlines).

Things to focus:
 - suggestions of illustrations to represent concepts (and remove need for wordy explainations)
 - Flow is going to be rough, but does the logical order make sense?
 - Anything from the intro/method sections you would suggest keeping? I'm considering deleting most of it.
