## *The lag–luminosity correlation in time-resolved episodes of long gamma-ray bursts* (2016)

### Flow

From [Gary Provost](https://www.garyprovost.com/how-to-tips/):

> This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

2016 thesis seemed to do the opposite of this quote. Every sentence felt like it had the maximum number of clauses glued in possible. Very information dense (good), but didn't let concepts stand on their own. The few sentences that are shorter just restate a clause from the previous sentence. Apparently I'm doing (a lesser version) in these notes now!

### Audience

Consistently had trouble trying to figure out what was concepts would be explained later and what was assumed knowledge. Parts spoke to assuming PH 455 (Astrophysics) - reasonable. Other parts referenced concepts or terms that I haven't run into yet through my varied and expanded exposure as student. Even more parts then assumed either MTH 437 (GR) or PH 499 (Cosmology) content.

How bad would it be to have a statement asserting the expertise level in the introduction?

> This thesis was written with a OSU physics major starting their capstone courses in mind. While not uniformly true for all physics students, base concepts of astrophysics and relativity, as would be covered in PH 455: Astrophysics and PH 335: Theoretical Mechanics, are treated as prior knowledge. Advanced concepts from general relativity or  programming & optimization (beyond PH 36X: Computational Lab) will be explained or given an explicit appendix reference.

Use of bold-faced for keywords to highlight terminology?

### Figures

- No figures or illustrations until most of the way through methods.
    - Background was short (page count), but so many concepts and things could be lightened by having a figure present
    - 4 pages of wall of text before demonstrating the light curve and lag time
- Similar figure problem to what I have:
    - Lots of whitespace
    - need the whole range to see behavior
    - size of figure versus page doesn't mesh
- Use of red/green color to denote data
    - colorblind/disability considerations?
- Figures present but not referenced in text?

## *Optimizing Monte Carlo simulation of the square-well fluid* (2015)

Interestingly, this paper also uses very long and dense sentences, but their construction is subtle enough that I got a few pages in before discovering it. 2016: I felt like I had to fight through each bit; 2015: I glided across the page.

The introduction feels well crafted: Sets the stage immediately and then gives context for the paper while simultaneously offering minor background/refresher on these concepts. Figure 1 is immediately accessible to aide in the focus of the paper. Final paragraph gives a nice succinct overview to the structure of the paper.

I really love that there seems to be a figure or some-other visual additive for the first 7 pages. Page 8 only has one called out equation, but we are into the Methods section at that point, and I'm fairly forgiving: All the aide has been leant in the beginning where we need it (to build the mental framework of what is going on).
