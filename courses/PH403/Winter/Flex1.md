Regarding tomorrow's meeting, I would prefer for you to *focus* on:

1. Introduction
2. A lot of what I have here is placeholder and leftover content from previous assignments. I'm looking for suggestions on approaching this section without writing a textbook introduction (3 chapters of background material). I'd like to offload content in terms of figures or illusitrations to reduce overall wordiness and allude to concepts/implications and therefore skirt around writing the textbook. 
3. I'm unconcerned with athestics about the document unless you already know how to implement things like Section/Subsection numbers and simplify references from "1.1 Motivation" to "1.1".
