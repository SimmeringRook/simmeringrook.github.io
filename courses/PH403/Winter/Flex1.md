Per our conversation last Friday, I took the motivation to proceed with a more succinct approach to introducing the various concepts of Galilean, special, and general relativity. Temporarily, I've removed the *Motivation* section which you marked up and we discussed as it doesn't currently mesh with the layout of the draft. I think I may need to add parts of it back in as a subsection or as concise enhancements and flavouring to bits of the Introduction.

I managed to resolve some of the LaTeX formatting problems I mentioned previously and as we also discussed, I've uploaded the raw document for your curiousity. If you do manage to provide additional feedback to this revision, I'll be very interested to hear about Figures 1 and 2.

Regarding tomorrow's meeting, I would prefer for you to *focus* on:

1. Introduction
2. A lot of what I have here is placeholder and leftover content from previous assignments. I'm looking for suggestions on approaching this section without writing a textbook introduction (3 chapters of background material). I'd like to offload content in terms of figures or illusitrations to reduce overall wordiness and allude to concepts/implications and therefore skirt around writing the textbook. 
3. I'm unconcerned with athestics about the document unless you already know how to implement things like Section/Subsection numbers and simplify references from "1.1 Motivation" to "1.1".
