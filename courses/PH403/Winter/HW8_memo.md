Based on feedback from Benjamin, the peer, and instructor: I think the introduction is in a fairly good state for the content that is currently present in the thesis. I will need to revisit the section once I start incorporating results from the more complicated section (#4: Differential Scattering). I'm simultaneously resisting any changes to Section 2.2 (Design Process) as I expect to have a vastly different type of section once work on Section 4 begins/resolves.

I am fairly happy with how Section 3 is progressing (as far as getting content in to describe figures). There's a notable style difference where Mathematica's results are being used as place holders. In the future, I hope to shift the figures around to avoid the awkward spacing that currently exists with pages 17 through 19.

Section 3.2 (and 3.2.1) are the roughest out of the results, as they contain information that has recently been derived. I am particularly interested in comments about the style change for the thought experiment on page 21:

- should it stand out from the main body?
  - with identation?
    - is it too much?
    - is it not enough?
  - with a frame/box?

I am expecting some comments around the manipulation of equations and derivation of relationships in Section 3.2, but I am curious where it stands on the spectrum of too much vs too little given the constraints:

- I can't show all the work 
  - you're not reading a homework solution
  - it's been done better (pedagogically) and in more detail in numerous textbooks
- some of the relations require concepts that I'm not intending on directly addressing (beyond the scope of the thesis)
  - E.g. basis 1-forms
