## Re: Section 3.2

While I did improved the wording in this section slightly, I'm also at a loss of how to proceed. In effect, this function does not truly describe what its intention was, as the system is under-determined. From my research, this is a consequence from moving into GR from SR. I am unsure if I should scrap this whole section (move to appendix, pending deletion for final submission) or keep it as is.

## Re: Comments about figure formatting

I still haven't adjusted those, and since they at least demonstrate the properties, I think I'll save fixing that formatting until the final revision stage.

Excerpt from my process memo for Janet:

> My short-term plan for moving forward is to work on using more placeholder Mathematica plots, if possible, to add figures for all the corresponding placeholder captions. At least then, I'll be able to work on the bulk of the synthesis in the remaining sections and just revisit with any necessary tweaks once I replace with Cartographer's output. I do introduce the notion of comparing the *exact* solutions as plotted by software like Mathematica versus the numeric approximations from Cartographer in Section 2.2. I might actually want to make that more of a feature moving forward, as it will give more of a comparison to contrast against and something for me to sanity check with as I work on that side of the research. My only fear with this idea is that the formatting of these plots takes an absorbent amount of time, and I'll be effectively doubling it.

## Re: Misc comments

I believe I've corrected mis-typed references (in latex) and proceeded to add some more detail in areas of confusion. I've also installed a spell checker to fix those issues moving forward. Areas of added content are:

- paragraph towards end of Section 1, trying to state motivation
- more explanation of GR concepts in Section 2.1:
    - addressing metric and line-element more (requested peer-edit)
    - brief comment on signature
    - footnote to remind the reader of what an inertial reference frame does
    - other minor additions/correction
