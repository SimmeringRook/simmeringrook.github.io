I have not made any progress on writing the thesis, so this uploaded draft is the exact same as for week 1. I have, however, almost completed the research work. I have working versions of theory for comparison, I just need a little more time to implement the experimental side of things.

I will be experiencing a slow down as I need to ensure I have an accurate backup of my computer before I drop it off at a repair shop to fix an issue before it suffers explicit hardware failure (assuming it hasn't already).

The biggest obstacles are increased work load from other classes (more assignments, but easier) eating into my available time and management of non-school appointments affecting my workflow (computer repair shop, doctor's appointments and tests, etc.).
