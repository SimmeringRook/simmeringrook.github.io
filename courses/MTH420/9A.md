## Questions

### Q1) What is the relationship to the previous sections on equilibrium problems?

We're still doing the same thing, but the change from discrete to continuous just means that the minimum is given by a function. In this case, we move from Lagrange Multiplers to the Euler-Lagrange equations.

### Q2) What is the weak form?

I have no idea what the distinction is between weak and strong in this section and in Chapter 2.

### Q3) How can we mix boundary conditions?

I thought we either had Dirichlet for both boundaries or Neumann, not a mixture?

### Q4) Is it possible to infer the boundary conditions from $A$?

I'm not sure if they are always given in the problem statement, or if we're supposed to be able to look at $A$ and determine them. Section 3.1 is very light on this.

## Reflections

I could connect with some of the material that Strang was discussing in this chapter, but not completely. I recognize little bits here and there like Sturm-Liouville equations and perturbations, and matricies representing operators, but it was very hard to even come up with questions from 3.1 to ask. I know that it didn't click, but I don't know enough to know what I need to ask about.
