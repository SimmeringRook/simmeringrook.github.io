My current topic idea was inspired by recently listening to the podcast episode[^-1]: *Series 2, Episode 1: FLUSH AND FORGET* from *A Podcast of Unnecessary Detail*. In this episode, Helen Arney talks about the issues of not having clearly marked buttons on dual flush toilets. Steve Mould also mentions the different design benefits from Australian/UK toilets compared to the American style with respect to how the siphon is set up. While our (American) style self-primes the siphon with each flush but requires a plug in the cistern to stop additional water flow, the UK versions do not. He further discusses how the plug style is more prone to leakage which offers another way to avoid unintentional water usage. I will obviously need to explore more primary sources for the next phase of this assignment.

The tie in to sustainability is pretty straightforward through conservation of filtered water and reducing the amount of waste water used by households and public locations. One of the examples I would like to discuss, if sufficient information is available from OSU, would be to compare the average water saving that could be obtained from switching all toilets at OSU's Corvallis campus to dual flush. Given OSU's annual reports and other publications[^-2], I am optimistic about being able to use them as an example.
