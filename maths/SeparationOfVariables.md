The method of separation of variables, at its heart, is a simple technique. On the surface, the name of the method describes the algorithm that you need to apply to a differential equation to find its solution. The simplest form of this method is used to solve differential equations in Integral Calculus, namely when solving equations of the form:

While being a simple algorithm, it is also an enormously powerful tool. Two examples of its common use are in solving the [[Quantum_State#Wave_function|wavefunction]] for a [[Hydrogen Atom|hydrogen atom]] ([[PH_426|PH 426]]) in [[Quantum Mechanics]] and the one-dimensional [[Waves#Guide_to_Solve_the_Non-dispersive_PDE|non-dispersive wave equation]] ([[PH_424|PH 424]]) for systems displaying [[Simple Harmonic Motion|harmonic motion]].
## General Forms
Any linear differential equation that can be written in the form of
  Y(y)dy=X(x)dx
Can be solved with this method. Essentially, weâ€™re making the ansatz that the solution is the product of functions. We do not use separation of variables if the equations cannot be simplified beyond the following:
  X(x)dx+Y(y)dy=C
These equations are called [[Exact Equations Method|exact equations]] and are solved with a similar but different method.

## Method
### Ordinary Differential Equations
Given a First order ODE that can be written in the form:
dy/dx = X(x)Y(y)
#  Isolate each variable to its own side:
#*  Y^-1(y)dy = X(x)dx
#  Integrate both sides.
