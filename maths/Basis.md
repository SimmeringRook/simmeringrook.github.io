# Basis
?>**Definition**: A basis is the set of [[Vector|vectors]] that [[Span|span]] the [[Vector Space]]. This set of
vectors must also be [[linearly Independent|linearly independent]] from each other.

## Linear Algebra
Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a [subspace](/maths/Subspace.md) of $\R^n$. The set of vectors, $\{v_1,\ \dots,\ v_n\}$ is called a basis if:
- $\mathcal{V} = Span(v_1, \dots, v_n)$
- $\{v_1,\ \dots,\ v_n\}$ is linearly independent

## Quantum Mechanics
A basis in [Quantum Mechanics](/physics/QuantumMechanics.md) is a set of vectors that [span](/maths/Span.md) the [Hilbert Space](/maths/HilbertSpace.md) for a [Quantum Mechanical System](/phyiscs/QuantumMechanicalSystem.md).

!> **Important**: [Linear Algebra](/maths/LinearAlgebra.md) only requires that each vector be linearly independent from each other. In Quantum Mechanics, we require that each basis vector is [orthogonal](/maths/Orthogonal.md).

### Properties
Each basis must exhibit the follow properties:
- [Normalization]
- [Orthogonality]
- [Completeness]
