**Definition**:
> A basis is the set of [[Vector|vectors]] that [[Span|span]] the [[Vector Space]]. This set of
vectors must also be [[linearly Independent|linearly independent]] from each other.

## [Linear Algebra]
Let V be a [[subspace]] of R^n. The set of vectors, {v_1, ..., v_k} is called a basis if:
- $V = Span(v_1, ..., v_k)$
- $\{v_1, ..., v_k\}$ is linearly independent

## [Quantum Mechanics]
A basis in [[Quantum Mechanics]] is a set of vectors that [[span]] the [[Hilbert Space]] for a [[Quantum Mechanical System]].

!> **Important**: [Linear Algebra] only requires that each vector be linearly independent from each other,
where as when we discuss bases (plural of basis) in [Quantum Mechanics], we require that
each basis vector is [Orthogonal|orthogonal].

### Properties
Each basis must exhibit the follow properties:
- [Normalization]]
- [Orthogonality]]
- [Completeness]]
