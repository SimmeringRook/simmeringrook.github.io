?>**Definition**:
Completeness in the context of vectors means we can use linear combinations of the
eigenvectors of a basis to describe any vector that exists in that space.

## Quantum Mechanics
In the context of [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanics]], this means we can use
linear combinations of the [[Basis|basis]] [[Ket|kets]] to describe any
[[Quantum State|quantum state]] for that basis's [[Hilbert Space]].

## Uses
### Completeness Relation
The sum of the outer products of the basis eigenvectors is equal to 1.

Also know as the Identity Operator.
