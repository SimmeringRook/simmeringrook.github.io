# Mixtures

Mixtures are substances (of [matter](/chem/Matter.md)) that consist of multiple types of molecules (either as [elements](/chem/Elements.md) or [compounds](/chem/Compounds.md)).

## Types

Mixtures can be further categorized by the distributions of their components:

  - **Homogeneous** mixtures refer to a uniform distribution of components. I.e., we can compare samples from two separate areas of the mixture and they will be identical.
  - **Heterogeneous** mixtures are the opposite. I.e., for two samples of a substance to match, there is some constraint that must be imposed on the location of where both samples are obtained; otherwise, in general, the two samples will not match.

> E.g., before blending milk and eggs with dry pancake mix, the top layer contains some (or one) of the two liquids, whereas the bottom contains the dry pancake mix. For two samples taken from this bowl to contain the same components, we have constraints on where the second sample must be taken. At this stage, we would state the bowl contains a **Heterogeneous Mixture** (of milk, eggs, and pancake mix). Once we *sufficiently* blend the liquid ingredients with the dry ingredients, the bowl will then contains a **Homogeneous Mixture** (that we now call 'Pancake Batter').
