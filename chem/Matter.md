# Matter

## Composition

Matter is composed of [molecules](/chem/Molecules.md) of either the same or different substances; the specific type of composition directly corresponds to nature of the physical and chemical properties of the greater whole.

### Descriptors

#### Elements

Substances that cannot be separated into different/simpler arrangements are called "[elements](/chem/Elements.md)".

> E.g., [Helium](/chem/Helium.md) gas is a substance that is comprised of a single element: He atoms.

#### Compounds

Substances that are comprised of different elements are called "[compounds](/chem/Compounds.md)".

> E.g., water ($H_2O$) is comprised of 2 different elements: [Hydrogen](/chem/Hydrogen.md) and [Oxygen](/chem/Oxygen.md).

#### Mixtures

Substances that consist of multiple types of molecules (either as elements or compounds) are called "[mixtures](/chem/Mixtures.md)". Mixtures can be further categorized by the distributions of their components:

  - **Homogeneous** mixtures refer to a uniform distribution of components.
  - **Heterogeneous** mixtures have a non-uniform distribution of components.

### Properties

There are two main categories for properties of a substance:

- Physical: "a property the substance displays without requiring a change to its composition"

> E.g. mass, volume, density, etc

- Chemical: "a property the substance displays **only** when the composition is changed (through a [chemical change](/chem/ChemicalChange.md)"

> E.g. color, flammability, acidity, etc

## States

### Solid

Molecules in a solid state correspond to rigid structures that preserve a fixed volume and shape. Individual molecules are allowed to vibrate in their space, but cannot move throughout the substance.

> E.g. a physical model can be constructed by connecting masses (molecules) together with springs. The masses are allowed to move about their equilibrium location, but they cannot swap places with other masses.

Solids have two subcategories:

  - **Crystalline**
    - well ordered internal structure, a repeating pattern
  - **Amorphous**
    - locally well ordered, but no overall repeating pattern

> E.g., diamond is a crystalline solid while graphene is an amorphous solid.
